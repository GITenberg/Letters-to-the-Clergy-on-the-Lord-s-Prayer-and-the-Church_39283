<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>The first reading of the Letters to the
Clerical Society to which they were first
addressed in September 1879, twenty-three
clergy being present, was prefaced
with the following remarks:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>A few words by way of introduction
will be absolutely necessary before I
proceed to read Mr. Ruskin's letters.
They originated simply in a proposal
of mine, which met with so ready and
willing a response, that it almost seemed
like a simultaneous thought. They are
addressed nominally to myself, as representing
the body of clergy whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>secretary I have the honour to be; they
are, in fact, therefore addressed to this
Society primarily. But in the course
of the next month or two they will also
be read to two other Clerical Societies,&mdash;the
Ormskirk and the Brighton
(junior),&mdash;who have acceded to my proposals
with much kindness, and in the
first case have invited me of their own
accord. I have undertaken, to the
best of my ability, to arrange and set
down the various expressions of opinion,
which will be freely uttered. In so
limited a time, many who may have
much to say that would be really valuable
will find no time to-day to deliver
it. Of these brethren, I beg that they
will do me the favour to express their
views at their leisure, in writing. The
original letters, the discussions, the
letters which may be suggested, and a
few comments of the Editor's, will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">vii</a></span>published in a volume which will appear,
I trust, in the beginning of the next
year.</p>

<p>I will now, if you please, undertake
the somewhat dangerous responsibility
of avowing my own impressions of the
letters I am about to read to you.
I own that I believe I see in these
papers the development of a principle of
the deepest interest and importance,&mdash;namely,
the application of the highest
standard in the interpretation of the
Gospel message <i>to</i> ourselves as clergymen,
and <i>from</i> ourselves to our congregations.
We have plenty elsewhere of
doctrine and dogma, and undefinable
shades of theological opinion. Let us
turn at last to practical questions presented
for our consideration by an
eminent layman whose field of work
lies quite as much in religion and ethics,
as it does, reaching to so splendid an
eminence, in Art. A man is wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
to show to both clergy and laity something
of the full force and meaning of
Gospel teaching. Many there are, and
I am of this number, whose cry is
"<i>Exoriare aliquis</i>."</p>

<p>I ask you, if possible, to do in an
hour what I have been for the last two
months trying to do, to divest myself
of old forms of thought, to cast off self-indulgent
views of our duty as ministers
of religion, to lift ourselves out of those
grooves in which we are apt to run so
smoothly and so complacently, persuading
ourselves that all is well just as
it is, and to endeavour to strike into a
sterner, harder path, beset with difficulties,
but still the path of duty. These
papers will demand a close, a patient,
and in some places, a few will think,
an indulgent consideration; but as a
whole, the standard taken is, as I firmly
believe, speaking only for myself, lofty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
and Christian to the extent of an almost
ideal perfection. If we do go forward
straight in the direction which Mr.
Ruskin points out, I know we shall
come, sooner or later, to a chasm right
across our path. Some of us, I hope,
will undauntedly cross it. Let each
judge for himself, <span title="tô telei pistin pherôn" class="grk">

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<h3>TO THE THIRD EDITION</h3>


<p>Having been urged to bring out a new
edition of the volume first edited by me
in 1880, and having willingly accepted
the invitation to do so, it will naturally
be expected that I should give some
account of the circumstances which have
led me to take the somewhat unusual
step of reviving a book which has for
twelve years been lying in a state of
suspended animation.</p>

<p>On the first conception of this volume
I applied to Messrs. Strahan, to produce
it before the reading and thinking world.
I should have done more wisely, no<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">xii</a></span>
doubt, had I offered the publication to
Mr. George Allen, Mr. Ruskin's well-known
publisher. It avails not to explain
why I chose a different course, of
which subsequent events only too soon
showed me the error; for after the
first edition had been sold off in a
week, and while the second was partly
sold and partly in preparation, Messrs.
Strahan's failure was announced, greatly
to my surprise; my somewhat isolated
position in the north country so far
from London keeping me very imperfectly
informed as to what was passing
in the literary world.</p>

<p>Reasonable, business-like people would
ask, why did I not make an effort to
rescue my little barque out of the general
wreckage, and why did I not, remembering
that Mr. Ruskin had with
much kindness freely bestowed the
copyright on me, save the second edition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">xiii</a></span>
and arrange with another publisher to
carry the work on? But I was failing
at the time with the illness which was
effectually cured only by a long sojourn
amidst or very near to the ice and snow
of the Alps. I was incapable of much
exertion, and, in fact, did not much care.
Besides which I am not a professed
literary man, being chiefly interested in
the work of my rural parish on the
borders of the Lake District, and should
not think it fair, or even possible, if
I may use an equestrian metaphor, to
attempt to ride two horses at once.</p>

<p>So Mr. Ruskin's letters, etc., as
edited by the present writer, came to
be entirely laid by, though not forgotten
by the hosts of Mr. Ruskin's friends,
followers, and admirers, who regretted
the suspension of so valuable a work
and so rich in great thoughts, teachings,
and suggestions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span></p>

<p>So things remained until August
1895, when a new friend, Mr. Smart,
gave me the pleasure of a visit, and
we talked over the circumstances just
narrated. Passing over several very
pleasant meetings in London, let it be
sufficient to mention that under the
impulse of Mr. George Allen's encouragement,
and cheered by the valuable
assistance and co-operation of another
friend, Mr. T. J. Wise, I agreed to
carry forward this Third Edition with
the full approbation and consent of
Mr. Ruskin himself, though it should be
said that on account of the state of
his health, I have been unable to consult
him on any of the details of the
publication.</p>

<p>But it will not be exactly the same
volume. Mr. Allen and Mr. Wise,
having gone over much of my correspondence
with Mr. Ruskin, were good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">xv</a></span>
enough to express a desire that some
of those letters addressed to myself
as a friend should be embodied in
the present volume, as being strongly
illustrative of his views on the subjects
dealt with in his more formal Letters
to the Clergy. I may claim pardon
for a feeling of great satisfaction with
the circumstance that in the course
of so long and so delicate a correspondence
as is contained in this volume,
never has a cloud overshadowed
our paths in this matter, never has a
cold blast from the east sent a shiver
through my system, nor, I presume,
his. For had Mr. Ruskin felt any
resentment at anything I wrote, with
his usual downright frankness he would
not have been backward for an hour
in expressing in vehement language
what he felt. But from first to last
my intercourse with that kind and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">xvi</a></span>
eminently distinguished friend has been
kept bright and happy by his unvarying
serenity.</p>

<p>The Letters from Clergy and Laity
in this Third Edition occupy much less
space than in the original one. It was
Mr. Ruskin's wish that they should
be subjected to some process of abridgment;
besides which the allowing of
space for the new feature of additional
Ruskin Letters made a curtailment in
another direction necessary. The plan
which seemed to me the least discourteous
to my numerous correspondents of
that time has been to make a selection
of passages from a certain number of
the Letters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Malleson</span>,&mdash;I could not
at once answer your important letter:
for, though I felt at once the impossibility
of my venturing to address such
an audience as you proposed, I am unwilling
to fail in answering to any call
relating to matters respecting which my
feelings have been long in earnest, if
in any wise it may be possible for me
to be of service therein. My health&mdash;or
want of it&mdash;now utterly forbids
my engagement in any duty involving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
excitement or acute intellectual effort;
but I think, before the first Tuesday in
August, I might be able to write one
or two letters to yourself, referring to,
and more or less completing, some passages
already printed in Fors and elsewhere,
which might, on your reading
any portions you thought available, become
matter of discussion during the
meeting at some leisure time, after its
own main purposes had been answered.</p>

<p>At all events, I will think over what
I should like, and be able, to represent
to such a meeting, and only beg you
not to think me insensible of the honour
done me by your wish, and of the
gravity of the trust reposed in me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Malleson</span>,&mdash;Walking, and
talking, are now alike impossible to
me;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> my strength is gone for both;
nor do I believe talking on such matters
to be of the least use except to promote,
between sensible people, kindly
feeling and knowledge of each other's
personal characters. I have every
trust in <i>your</i> kindness and truth; nor
do I fear being myself misunderstood
by you; what I may be able to put
into written form, so as to admit of
being laid before your friends in council,
must be set down without any question
of personal feeling&mdash;as simply as a
mathematical question or demonstration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>The first exact question which it
seems to me such an assembly may
be earnestly called upon by laymen
to solve, is surely axiomatic: the definition
of themselves as a body, and
of their business as such.</p>

<p>Namely: as clergymen of the Church
of England, do they consider themselves
to be so called merely as the
attached servants of a particular state?
Do they, in their quality of guides, hold
a position similar to that of the guides
of Chamouni or Grindelwald, who being
a numbered body of examined and
trustworthy persons belonging to those
several villages, have nevertheless no
Chamounist or Grindelwaldist opinions
on the subject of Alpine geography or
glacier walking: but are prepared to
put into practice a common and universal
science of Locality and Athletics,
founded on sure survey and successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
practice? Are the clergymen of the
Ecclesia of England thus simply the
attached and salaried guides of England
and the English, in the way,
known of all good men, that leadeth
unto life?&mdash;or are they, on the contrary,
a body of men holding, or in
any legal manner required, or compelled
to hold, opinions on the subject&mdash;say,
of the height of the Celestial
Mountains, the crevasses which go down
quickest to the pit, and other cognate
points of science,&mdash;differing from, or
even contrary to, the tenets of the
guides of the Church of France, the
Church of Italy, and other Christian
countries?</p>

<p>Is not this the first of all questions
which a Clerical Council has to answer
in open terms?</p>

<span class="smcap">Brantwood</span>, <i>6th July</i>, 1879.
</div>

<p>My first letter contained a Layman's
plea for a clear answer to the question,
"What is a clergyman of the
Church of England?" Supposing the
answer to this first to be, that the
clergy of the Church of England are
teachers, not of the Gospel to England,
but of the Gospel to all nations; and
not of the Gospel of Luther, nor of
the Gospel of Augustine, but of the
Gospel of Christ,&mdash;then the Layman's
second question would be:</p>

<p>Can this Gospel of Christ be put
into such plain words and short terms
as that a plain man may understand
it?&mdash;and, if so, would it not be, in a
quite primal sense, desirable that it
should be so, rather than left to be
gathered out of Thirty-nine Articles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
written by no means in clear English,
and referring, for further explanation
of exactly the most important point
in the whole tenor of their teaching,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
to a "Homily of Justification,"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> which
is not generally in the possession, or
even probably within the comprehension,
of simple persons?</p>

</div>

<p>I am so very glad that you approve
of the letter plan, as it enables me to
build up what I would fain try to say,
of little stones, without lifting too much
for my strength at once; and the sense
of addressing a friend who understands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
me and sympathizes with me prevents
my being brought to a stand by
continual need for apology, or fear of
giving offence.</p>

<p>But yet I do not quite see why you
should feel my asking for a simple
and comprehensible statement of the
Christian Gospel as startling. Are
you not bid to go into <i>all</i> the world
and preach it to every creature? (I
should myself think the clergyman most
likely to do good who accepted the
<span title="pasê tê ktisei" class="grk"><i>πάση τῆ κτίσει</i></span> so literally as at least to
sympathize with St. Francis' sermon
to the birds, and to feel that feeding
either sheep or fowls, or unmuzzling
the ox, or keeping the wrens alive in
the snow, would be received by their
Heavenly Feeder as the <i>perfect</i> fulfilment
of His "Feed My sheep" in the
higher sense.)</p>

<p>That's all a parenthesis; for although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
I should think that your good company
would all agree that kindness to animals
was a kind of preaching to them, and
that hunting and vivisection were a
kind of blasphemy to them, I want
only to put the sterner question before
your council, <i>how</i> this Gospel is to be
preached either <span title="pantachou" class="grk">"<i>πανταχôυ</i>"</span>
or to <span title="panta ta ethnê" class="grk">"<i>πάντα
τὰ ἔθνη</i></span>," if first its preachers have not
determined quite clearly what it <i>is</i>?
And might not such definition, acceptable
to the entire body of the Church
of Christ, be arrived at by merely explaining,
in their completeness and life,
the terms of the Lord's Prayer&mdash;the
first words taught to children all over
the Christian world?</p>

<p>I will try to explain what I mean
of its several articles, in following
letters; and in answer to the question
with which you close your last, I can
only say that you are at perfect liberty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
to use any, or all, or any parts of them,
as you think good. Usually, when I
am asked if letters of mine may be
printed, I say: "Assuredly, provided
only that you print them entire." But
in your hands, I withdraw even this
condition, and trust gladly to your
judgment, remaining always</p>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Brantwood</span>, <i>10th July</i>, 1879.
</div>

<p>My meaning, in saying that the
Lord's Prayer might be made a foundation
of Gospel-teaching, was not that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
it contained all that Christian ministers
have to teach; but that it contains
what all Christians are agreed upon as
first to be taught; and that no good
parish-working pastor in any district
of the world but would be glad to take
his part in making it clear and living
to his congregation.</p>

<p>And the first clause of it, of course
rightly explained, gives us the ground
of what is surely a mighty part of the
Gospel&mdash;its "first and great commandment,"
namely, that we have a Father
whom we <i>can</i> love, and are required
to love, and to desire to be with Him
in Heaven, wherever that may be.</p>

<p>And to declare that we have such a
loving Father, whose mercy is over <i>all</i>
His works, and whose will and law is
so lovely and lovable that it is sweeter
than honey, and more precious than
gold, to those who can "taste" and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
"see" that the Lord is Good&mdash;this,
surely, is a most pleasant and glorious
good message and <i>spell</i> to bring
to men&mdash;as distinguished from the evil
message and accursed spell that Satan
has brought to the nations of the world
instead of it, that they have no Father,
but only "a consuming fire" ready to
devour them, unless they are delivered
from its raging flame by some scheme
of pardon for all, for which they are to
be thankful, not to the Father, but to
the Son.</p>

<p>Supposing this first article of the true
Gospel agreed to, how would the blessing
that closes the epistles of that
Gospel become intelligible and living,
instead of dark and dead: "The grace
of Christ, and the <i>love</i> of God, and the
fellowship of the Holy Ghost,"&mdash;the
most <i>tender</i> word being that used of
the Father!</p>

<div class = "right">
<span class="smcap">Brantwood</span>, <i>12th July</i>, 1879.
</div>

<p>I wonder how many, even of those
who honestly and attentively join in
our Church services, attach any distinct
idea to the second clause of the Lord's
Prayer&mdash;the <i>first petition</i> of it&mdash;the first
thing that they are ordered by Christ
to seek of their Father?</p>

<p>Am I unjust in thinking that most
of them have little more notion on the
matter than that God has forbidden
"bad language," and wishes them to
pray that everybody may be respectful
to Him?</p>

<p>Is it any otherwise with the Third
Commandment? Do not most look on
it merely in the light of the statute on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
swearing? and read the words "will not
hold him guiltless" merely as a passionless
intimation that however carelessly
a man may let out a round oath,
there really <i>is</i> something wrong in it?</p>

<p>On the other hand, can anything be
more tremendous than the words
themselves&mdash;double-negatived:</p>

<div class="centgrk" title="ou gar mê katharisê ... kurios">
<i>"οὐ γὰρ μὴ καθαρίσῃ ... κύριος</i>"?<br />
</div>

<p><a id="For_other"></a>For <i>other</i> sins there is washing;&mdash;for
this&mdash;none! the seventh verse (Exod.
xx.), in the Septuagint, marking the
real power rather than the English,
which (I suppose) is literal to the
Hebrew.</p>

<p>To my layman's mind, of practical
needs in the present state of the Church,
nothing is so immediate as that of
explaining to the congregation the
meaning of being gathered in His
name, and having Him in the midst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
of them; as, on the other hand, of
being gathered in blasphemy of His
name, and having the devil in the midst
of them&mdash;presiding over the prayers
which have become an abomination.</p>

<p>For the entire body of the texts in
the Gospel against hypocrisy are one
and all nothing but the expansion of
the threatening that closes the Third
Commandment. For as "the name
whereby He shall be called is <span class="smcap">The
Lord our Righteousness</span>,"&mdash;so the
taking that name in vain is the sum
of "the deceivableness of <i>un</i>righteousness
in them that perish."</p>

<p>Without dwelling on the possibility&mdash;which
I do not myself, however, for
a moment doubt&mdash;of an honest clergyman's
being able actually to prevent
the entrance among his congregation
of persons leading openly wicked lives,
could any subject be more vital to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
purposes of your meetings than the
difference between the present and the
probable state of the Christian Church
which would result, were it more the
effort of zealous parish priests, instead
of getting wicked <i>poor</i> people to <i>come</i>
to church, to get wicked rich ones to
stay out of it?</p>

<p>Lest, in any discussion of such question,
it might be, as it too often is,
alleged that "the Lord looketh upon
the heart," etc, let me be permitted to
say&mdash;with as much positiveness as may
express my deepest conviction&mdash;that,
while indeed it is the Lord's business
to look upon the heart, it is the pastor's
to look upon the hands and the lips;
and that the foulest oaths of the thief

<span class="smcap">Brantwood</span>, <i>14th July</i>, 1879.
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Malleson</span>,&mdash;Sincere thanks
for both your letters and the proofs
sent.  Your comment and conducting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
link, when needed, will be of the greatest
help and value, I am well assured,
suggesting what you know will be the
probable feeling of your hearers, and
the point that will come into question.</p>

<p>Yes, certainly, that "His" in the
fourth line<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> was meant to imply that
eternal presence of Christ; as in another
passage,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> referring to the Creation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
"when His right hand strewed the
snow on Lebanon, and smoothed the
slopes of Calvary;" but in so far as
we dwell on that truth, "Hast thou
seen <i>Me</i>, Philip, and not the Father?"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>we are not teaching the people what is
specially the Gospel of <i>Christ</i> as having
a distinct function, namely, to <i>serve</i> the
Father, and do the Father's will. And
in all His human relations to us, and
commands to us, it is as the Son of Man,
not as the "power of God and wisdom
of God," that He acts and speaks. Not
as the Power; for <i>He</i> must pray, like
one of us. Not as the Wisdom; for
He must not know "if it be possible"
His prayer should be heard.</p>


<p>And in what I want to say of the
third clause of His prayer (<i>His</i>, not
merely as His ordering, but His using),
it is especially this comparison between
<i>His</i> kingdom, and His Father's, that
I want to see the disciples guarded
against. I believe very few, even of
the most earnest, using that petition,
realize that it is the Father's&mdash;not the
Son's&mdash;kingdom, that they pray may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
come,&mdash;although the whole prayer is
foundational on that fact: "<i>For</i> Thine is
the kingdom, the power, and the glory."
And I fancy that the mind of the most
faithful Christian is quite led away from
its proper hope, by dwelling on the
reign&mdash;or the coming again&mdash;of Christ;
which, indeed, they are to look for, and
<i>watch</i> for, but not to pray for. Their
prayer is to be for the greater kingdom
to which He, risen and having all His
enemies under His feet, is to surrender
<i>His</i>, "that God may be All in All."</p>

<p>And, though the greatest, it is that
everlasting kingdom which the poorest
of us can advance. We cannot hasten
Christ's coming. "Of the day and the
hour, knoweth no man." But the kingdom
of God is as a grain of mustard-seed:&mdash;we
can sow of it; it is as a
foam-globe of leaven:&mdash;we can mingle
it; and its glory and its joy are that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
even the birds of the air can lodge in
the branches thereof.</p>

<p>Forgive me for getting back to my
sparrows; but truly in the present state
of England, the fowls of the air are the
only creatures, tormented and murdered
as they are, that yet have here and
there nests, and peace, and joy in the
Holy Ghost. And it would be well if
many of us, in reading that text, "The
kingdom of God is <span class="smcap">not</span> meat and drink,"
had even got so far as to the understanding
that it is at least <i>as much</i>, and that
until we had fed the hungry, there was
no power in us to inspire the unhappy.</p>

at once that I am sure it will do much
good, and will be upright and intelligible,

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5">[5]</a>
Referring to the closing sentence of the third
paragraph of the fifth letter, which <i>seemed</i> to express
what I felt could not be Mr. Ruskin's full meaning,
I pointed out to him the following sentence in
"Modern Painters:"&mdash;
</p><p>
"When, in the desert, Jesus was girding Himself
for the work of life, angels of life came and ministered
unto Him; now, in the fair world, when He is
girding Himself for the work of death, the ministrants
came to Him from the grave; but from the
grave conquered. One from the tomb under Abarim,
which <i>His</i> own hand had sealed long ago; the other
from the rest which He had entered without seeing
corruption."
</p><p>
On this I made a remark somewhat to the following
effect: that I felt sure Mr. Ruskin regarded the
loving work of the Father and of the Son as <i>equal</i>
in the forgiveness of sins and redemption of mankind;
that what is done by the Father is in reality
done also by the Son; and that it is by a mere
accommodation to human infirmity of understanding
that the doctrine of the Trinity is revealed to us in
language, inadequate indeed to convey divine truths,
but still the only language possible; and I asked
whether some such feeling was not present in his
mind when he used the pronoun "His" in the above
passage from "Modern Painters" of the Son, where
it would be usually understood of the Father; and
as a corollary, whether, in the letter, he does not
himself fully recognise the fact of the redemption of
the world by the loving self-sacrifice of the Son being
in entire concurrence with the equally loving will of
the Father. This, as well as I can recollect, is the
origin of the passage in the second paragraph in this
seventh letter.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor of Letters.</span></p></div>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Brantwood</span>, <i>9th August</i>, 1879.
</div>

<p>I was reading the second chapter of
Malachi this morning by chance, and
wondering how many clergymen ever
read it, and took to heart the "commandment
for <i>them</i>."</p>

<p>For they are always ready enough
to call themselves priests (though they
know themselves to be nothing of the
sort), whenever there is any dignity to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
be got out of the title; but, whenever
there is any good, hot scolding or unpleasant
advice given them by the prophets,
in that self-assumed character of
theirs, they are as ready to quit it as ever
Dionysus his lion-skin, when he finds
the character of Herakles inconvenient.</p>

<p>"Ye have wearied the Lord with your
words;" (yes, and some of His people
too, in your time), "yet ye say, Wherein
have we wearied Him? When ye say,
Every one that doeth evil is good in
the sight of the Lord, and He delighteth
in them; or, Where is the God
of judgment?"</p>

<p>How many, again and again I wonder,
of the lively young ecclesiastics supplied
to the increasing demand of our west
ends of flourishing Cities of the Plain,
ever consider what sort of sin it is for
which God (unless they lay it to heart)
will "curse their blessings, and spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
dung upon their faces;" or have understood,
even in the dimmest manner,
what part <i>they</i> had taken, and were
taking, in "corrupting the covenant of
the Lord with Levi, and causing many
to stumble at the Law."</p>

<p>Perhaps the most subtle and unconscious
way in which the religious
teachers upon whom the ends of the
world are come, have done this, is in
never telling their people the meaning
of the clause in the Lord's Prayer,
which, of all others, their most earnest
hearers have oftenest on their lips:
"Thy will be done." They allow their
people to use it as if their Father's will
were always to kill their babies, or do
something unpleasant to them; and
following comfort and wealth, instead
of explaining to them that the first and
intensest article of their Father's will
was their own sanctification; and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
the one only path to national prosperity
and to domestic peace, was to understand
what the will of the Lord was,
and to do all they could to get it done.
Whereas one would think, by the tone
of the eagerest preachers nowadays,
that they held their blessed office to
be that, not of showing men how to do
their Father's will on earth, but how to
get to heaven without doing any of it
either here or there!</p>

<p>I say, especially, the most eager
preachers; for nearly the whole Missionary
body (with the hottest Evangelistic
sect of the English Church) is
at this moment composed of men who
think the Gospel they are to carry to
mend the world with, forsooth, is that,
"If any man sin, he hath an Advocate
with the Father;" while I have never
yet, in my own experience, met either
with a Missionary or a Town Bishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
who so much as professed himself "to
understand what the will of the Lord"
was, far less to teach anybody else to
do it; and for fifty preachers, yes, and
fifty hundreds whom I have heard proclaiming
the Mediator of the New
Testament, that "they which were
called might receive the promise of
eternal inheritance," I have never yet
heard so much as <i>one</i> heartily proclaiming
against all those "deceivers with
vain words" (Eph. v. 6), that "no
covetous person which is an idolater,
hath <i>any</i> inheritance in the kingdom
of Christ, or of God;" and on myself
personally and publicly challenging the
Bishops of England generally, and by
name the Bishop of Manchester, to say
whether usury was, or was not, according
to the will of God, I have received
no answer from any one of them.

<p>I have allowed myself, in the beginning
of this letter, to dwell on the
equivocal use of the word "Priest" in
the English Church (see "Christopher
Harvey," Grosart's edition, p. 38),
because the assumption of the mediatorial,
in defect of the pastoral, office
by the clergy fulfils itself, naturally and
always, in their pretending to absolve
the sinner from his punishment, instead
of purging him from his sin; and practically,
in their general patronage and
encouragement of all the iniquity of the
world, by steadily preaching away the
penalties of it. So that the great cities
of the earth, which ought to be the
places set on its hills, with the Temple
of the Lord in the midst of them, to
which the tribes should go up,&mdash;centres
to the Kingdoms and Provinces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
Honour, Virtue, and the Knowledge of
the law of God,&mdash;have become, instead,
loathsome centres of fornication and
covetousness&mdash;the smoke of their sin
going up into the face of heaven like
the furnace of Sodom, and the pollution
of it rotting and raging through the
bones and the souls of the peasant
people round them, as if they were each
a volcano whose ashes broke out in
blains upon man and upon beast.</p>

<p>And in the midst of them, their
freshly-set-up steeples ring the crowd to
a weekly prayer that the rest of their
lives may be pure and holy, while they
have not the slightest intention of purifying,
sanctifying, or changing their
lives in any the smallest particular;
and their clergy gather, each into himself,
the curious dual power, and Janus-faced
majesty in mischief, of the
prophet that prophesies falsely, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
the priest that bears rule by his
means.</p>

<p>I am very glad of your little note
from Brighton. I thought it needless
to send the two letters there, which you
will find at home; and they pretty
nearly end all <i>I</i> want to say; for the
remaining clauses of the prayer touch
on things too high for me. But I will
send you one concluding letter about
them.</p>

<p>I retained the foregoing letter by me
till now, lest you should think it written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
in any haste or petulance: but it is
every word of it deliberate, though expressing
the bitterness of twenty years
of vain sorrow and pleading concerning
these things. Nor am I able to write,
otherwise, anything of the next following
clause of the prayer;&mdash;for no words
could be burning enough to tell the
evils which have come on the world
from men's using it thoughtlessly and
blasphemously, praying God to give
them what they are deliberately resolved
to steal. For all true Christianity
is known&mdash;as its Master was&mdash;in
breaking of bread, and all false
Christianity in stealing it.</p>

<p>Let the clergyman only apply&mdash;with
impartial and level sweep&mdash;to his congregation
the great pastoral order:
"The man that will not work, neither
should he eat;" and be resolute in
requiring each member of his flock to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
tell him <i>what</i>&mdash;day by day&mdash;they do to
earn their dinners;&mdash;and he will find an
entirely new view of life and its sacraments
open upon him and them.</p>

<p>For the man who is not&mdash;day by
day&mdash;doing work which will earn his
dinner, must be stealing his dinner;
and the actual fact is, that the great
mass of men calling themselves Christians
do actually live by robbing the
poor of their bread, and by no other
trade whatsoever; and the simple examination
of the mode of the produce
and consumption of European food&mdash;who
digs for it, and who eats it&mdash;will
prove that to any honest human soul.</p>

<p>Nor is it possible for any Christian
Church to exist but in pollutions and
hypocrisies beyond all words, until the
virtues of a life moderate in its self-indulgence,
and wide in its offices
of temporal ministry to the poor, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
insisted on as the normal conditions
in which, only, the prayer to God for
the harvest of the earth is other than
blasphemy.</p>

<p>In the second place. Since in the
parable in Luke, the bread asked for
is shown to be also, and chiefly, the
Holy Spirit (Luke xi. 13), and the
prayer, "Give us each day our daily
bread" is, in its fulness, the disciples'
"Lord, evermore give us <i>this</i> bread,"&mdash;the
clergyman's question to his whole
flock, primarily literal, "Children, have
ye here any meat?" must ultimately
be always the greater spiritual one:
"Children, have ye here any Holy
Spirit?" or, "Have ye not heard yet
whether there <i>be</i> any? and, instead of
a Holy Ghost the Lord and Giver of
Life, do you only believe in an unholy
mammon, Lord and Giver of Death?"</p>

<p>The opposition between the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
Lords has been, and will be as long as
the world lasts, absolute, irreconcilable,
mortal; and the clergyman's first message
to his people of this day is&mdash;if
he be faithful&mdash;"Choose ye this day,
whom ye will serve."</p>

<span class="smcap">Brantwood</span>, <i>3rd September</i>.
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Malleson</span>,&mdash;I have been
very long before trying to say so much
as a word about the sixth clause of the
Pater; for whenever I began thinking
of it, I was stopped by the sorrowful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
sense of the hopeless task you poor
clergymen had, nowadays, in recommending
and teaching people to love
their enemies, when their whole energies
were already devoted to swindling their
friends.</p>

<p>But, in any days, past or now, the
clause is one of such difficulty, that,
to understand it, means almost to
know the love of God which passeth
knowledge.</p>

<p>But, at all events, it is surely the pastor's
duty to prevent his flock from <i>mis</i>-understanding
it; and above all things
to keep them from supposing that God's
forgiveness is to be had simply for the
asking, by those who "wilfully sin after
they have received the knowledge of
the truth."</p>

<p>There is one very simple lesson, also,
needed especially by people in circumstances
of happy life, which I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
never heard fully enforced from the
pulpit, and which is usually the more
lost sight of, because the fine and inaccurate
word "trespasses" is so often
used instead of the simple and accurate
one, "debts." Among people well
educated and happily circumstanced, it
may easily chance that long periods of
their lives pass without any such conscious
sin as could, on any discovery
or memory of it, make them cry out,
in truth and in pain, "I have sinned
against the Lord." But scarcely an
hour of their happy days can pass over
them without leaving&mdash;were their hearts
open&mdash;some evidence written there that
they have "left undone the things that
they ought to have done," and giving
them bitterer and heavier cause to cry
and cry again&mdash;for ever, in the pure
words of their Master's prayer, "Dimitte
nobis <i>debita</i> nostra."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p>In connection with the more accurate
translation of "debts," rather than "trespasses,"
it would surely be well to keep
constantly in the mind of complacent
and inoffensive congregations, that in
Christ's own prophecy of the manner
of the last judgment, the condemnation
is pronounced only on the sins of omission:
"I was hungry, and ye gave Me
no meat."</p>

<p>But, whatever the manner of sin, by
offence or defect, which the preacher
fears in his people, surely he has of late
been wholly remiss in compelling their
definite recognition of it, in its several
and personal particulars. Nothing in the
various inconsistency of human nature
is more grotesque than its willingness
to be taxed with any quantity of sins in
the gross, and its resentment at the
insinuation of having committed the
smallest parcel of them in detail.  And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
the English Liturgy, evidently drawn
up with the amiable intention of making
religion as pleasant as possible to a
people desirous of saving their souls
with no great degree of personal inconvenience,
is perhaps in no point more
unwholesomely lenient than in its concession
to the popular conviction that
we may obtain the present advantage,
and escape the future punishment, of
any sort of iniquity, by dexterously concealing
the manner of it from man, and
triumphantly confessing the quantity of
it to God.</p>

<p>Finally, whatever the advantages and
decencies of a form of prayer, and how
wide soever the scope given to its collected
passages, it cannot be at one and
the same time fitted for the use of a
body of well-taught and experienced
Christians, such as should join the services
of a Church nineteen centuries old,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>&mdash;and
adapted to the needs of the timid
sinner who has that day first entered
its porch, or of the remorseful publican
who has only recently become sensible
of his call to a pew.</p>

<p>And surely our clergy need not be
surprised at the daily increasing distrust
in the public mind of the efficacy of
Prayer, after having so long insisted on
their offering supplication, <i>at least</i> every
Sunday morning at eleven o'clock, that
the rest of their lives hereafter might be
pure and holy, leaving them conscious
all the while that they would be similarly
required to inform the Lord next
week, at the same hour, that "there was
no health in them"!</p>

<p>Among the much rebuked follies and
abuses of so-called "Ritualism," none
that I have heard of are indeed so
dangerously and darkly "Ritual" as
this piece of authorized mockery of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>

regard what could not but appear to the
general mind Utopian in designs for the
action of the Christian Church, surely
might best be answered by appeal to
the consistent tone of the prayer we
have been examining.</p>

<p>Is not every one of its petitions for a
perfect state? and is not this last clause
of it, of which we are to think to-day&mdash;if
fully understood&mdash;a petition not only
for the restoration of Paradise, but of
Paradise in which there shall be no
deadly fruit, or, at least, no tempter to
praise it? And may we not admit that
it is probably only for want of the
earnest use of this last petition, that not
only the preceding ones have become
formal with us, but that the private and
simply restricted prayer for the little
things we each severally desire, has become
by some Christians dreaded and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
unused, and by others used faithlessly,
and therefore with disappointment?</p>

<p>And is it not for want of this special
directness and simplicity of petition,
and of the sense of its acceptance, that
the whole nature of prayer has been
doubted in our hearts, and disgraced
by our lips; that we are afraid to
ask God's blessing on the earth, when
the scientific people tell us He has
made previous arrangements to curse
it; and that, instead of obeying, without
fear or debate, the plain order,
"Ask, and ye shall receive, that your
joy may be full," we sorrowfully sink
back into the apology for prayer, that
"it is a wholesome exercise, even when
fruitless," and that we ought piously
always to suppose that the text really
means no more than "Ask, and ye
shall <i>not</i> receive, that your joy may
be <i>empty</i>"?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<p>Supposing we were first all of us
quite sure that we <i>had</i> prayed, honestly,
the prayer against temptation, and that
we would thankfully be refused anything
we had set our hearts upon, if
indeed God saw that it would lead us
into evil, might we not have confidence
afterwards that He in whose hand the
King's heart is, as the rivers of water,
would turn our tiny little hearts also
in the way that they should go, and
that <i>then</i> the special prayer for the
joys He taught them to seek, would
be answered to the last syllable, and
to overflowing?</p>

<p>It is surely scarcely necessary to say,
farther, what the holy teachers of all
nations have invariably concurred in
showing,&mdash;that faithful prayer implies
always correlative exertion; and that
no man can ask honestly or hopefully
to be delivered from temptation, unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
he has himself honestly and firmly determined
to do the best he can to keep
out of it. But, in modern days, the
first aim of all Christian parents is to
place their children in circumstances
where the temptations (which they are
apt to call "opportunities") may be as
great and as many as possible; where
the sight and promise of "all these
things" in Satan's gift may be brilliantly
near; and where the act of "falling
down to worship me" may be partly
concealed by the shelter, and partly
excused, as involuntary, by the pressure,
of the concurrent crowd.</p>

<p>In what respect the kingdoms of the
world, and the glory of <i>them</i>, differ
from the Kingdom, the Power, and the
Glory, which are God's for ever, is
seldom, as far as I have heard, intelligibly
explained from the pulpit; and
still less the irreconcilable hostility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
between the two royalties and realms
asserted in its sternness of decision.</p>

<p>Whether it be indeed Utopian to
believe that the kingdom we are taught
to pray for <i>may</i> come&mdash;verily come&mdash;for
the asking, it is surely not for man
to judge; but it is at least at his choice
to resolve that he will no longer render
obedience, nor ascribe glory and power,
to the Devil. If he cannot find strength
in himself to advance towards Heaven,
he may at least say to the power of
Hell, "Get thee behind me;" and
staying himself on the testimony of
Him who saith, "Surely I come
quickly," ratify his happy prayer with
the faithful "Amen, even so, come,
Lord Jesus."</p>

<h3><a name="ESSAYS_AND_COMMENTS_BEGIN" id="ESSAYS_AND_COMMENTS_BEGIN"></a>ESSAYS AND COMMENTS</h3>


<p>Feeling deeply, and anxiously, the greatness
of the responsibility laid upon me to act, as it
were, the part of an envoy between so eminent
a teacher as Mr. Ruskin and my brethren in
the Ministry, I have thought that it might not
be taken amiss if I prefaced my account of
the origin of the series of letters placed in
my hands for publication (see <a href="#IV">Letter 8th July,
1879</a>)<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> with just a mere allusion to one written
to me four years ago.</p>


<p>One or two imperfect conversations, leading
up to the subject of the Resurrection, which
had been broken off by accidental circumstances,
together with the letter alluded to,
had stimulated in me a feeling of something
more than curiosity&mdash;rather one of anxious
interest&mdash;to learn more of Mr. Ruskin's
views<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
upon matters which are at the present day
giving rise to a good deal of agitated discussion
among intellectual men.</p>

<p>I am thankful to be able to avow that, for
my own part, I am a firm and conscientious,
not a thoughtless and passive, believer in the
doctrines of the Church of Christ as held by
the majority of serious-minded religious men
in the Established Church. Mr. Ruskin was
mistaken in his much too ready assumption
that I (simply because I am a clergyman) am
a believer on compulsion; that for the peace
of my soul I have only to thank religious
anæsthetics, and that I ever preach against
the wickedness of involuntary doubt. God
forbid that I should ever take on myself to
denounce as wilful sin any scruples of conscience
which owe their origin to honest
inquiries after truth. I trust that he knows
me better now.</p>

<p>Feeling thus decided and certain as to the
ground I stand upon, and earnestly desirous
on every account to investigate the nature of
Mr. Ruskin's doubts, whatever they might be,
in a most fraternal spirit, as a kindly-favoured
friend and neighbour (for, in our lake and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
mountain district, an interval of a dozen
miles does not destroy neighbourhood between
spirits with any degree of kinship), I
sought for a more lengthened conversation,
and obtained the opportunity without difficulty.
The occasion was found in a very
delightful summer afternoon on the lake, and
up the sides of the Old Man of Coniston, to
view a group of remarkable rocks by the
desolate, storm-beaten crags of Goat's Water,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
that saddest and loneliest of mountain tarns,
which lies in the deep hollow between the
mountain and its opposing buttress, the Dow
Crags. This most interesting ramble in the
undivided company of one so highly and so
deservedly valued in the world of letters and
of art and higher matters yet, served to my
mind for more purposes than one, while we
wandered amidst impressive scenes, passing
from the sweet and gentle peaceful loveliness
of the bright green vale of Coniston
and its charming lake to the bleak desolation,
the terrible sublimity of the mountain
tarn barriered in by its stupendous crags,
amongst which lay those singular-looking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
weather-beaten, and lightning-riven rocks
which were the more immediate object of
our visit.</p>


<p>But to myself the chief and happiest result
of our conversation was the firm conviction
that neither the censorious and unthinking
world, nor perhaps even Mr. Ruskin himself,
knows how deeply and truly a Christian man,
in the widest sense of the word, Mr. Ruskin
is. It is neither the time nor the place, nor
indeed would it be consistent with propriety,
to analyze before others the convictions formed
on that memorable summer afternoon. It must
suffice for the present to say that the opinions
then formed laid the foundation of a friendship
on a happier basis than that which
had heretofore been permitted me, and prepared
my way to enter with confidence upon
the plan of which the present volume is the
fruit.</p>

<p>Last June, in the course of a short visit to
Brantwood, I proposed to Mr. Ruskin to come
to address the members of a Northern Clerical
Society, a body of some seventy or eighty
clergy, who have done me the honour to appoint
me their honorary secretary, now for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
about nine years, since its foundation. On
the ground of impaired health, the legacy left
behind it by the serious illness which had,
two years before, threatened even his life,
Mr. Ruskin excused himself from appearing
in person before our Society; but proposed
instead to write letters to me which might
serve as a basis for discussion amongst us.</p>

<p><a href="#I">Letter I.</a> will explain the origin of the series
that come after.</p>


<p><span class="sidelink"><a href="#II">Letter II</a></span></p>
<h4>On Letter II</h4>


<p>The question laid down in this letter, cleared
of all metaphorical ornament, is, as is perfectly
natural and instinctive with Mr. Ruskin, one
which goes down to the foundation of things&mdash;here,
the character and mission of the Christian
ministry. Are we (Mr. Ruskin implies, Are
we <i>not</i>?) bound to believe and to teach after
certain formulæ, which, being many of them
peculiar to ourselves, separate us from the
national Churches of France and Italy? Are
we free, or are we bound? Or do we enjoy
a reasonable amount of liberty and no more?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
On the platform we occupy do we allow none
but English Churchmen to stand? Must we
keep all other Christians at arm's length? Do
the conditions attached to the emoluments we
receive prohibit us from holding or teaching
any other opinions than those we have subscribed
to?</p>

<p>It is a question not to be approached without
a tremor. But no abstract answer can well
be given. Human nature replies for itself in
the spectacle of the clergy of the Church of
England divided and subdivided; here deeply
sundered, there of different complexions amicably
blending together, holding every variety
of opinion which the Church allows or disallows
within her borders. Human nature
absolutely refuses to be shackled in its positive
beliefs. Authority may try, or even appear
to perform, the feat of fettering thought and
making men march in step to one common
end in orderly ranks; but she has invariably
at last to confess her impotence.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>



<p>The ministers of the Church cannot safely be
set free by Act of Parliament to teach whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
seems good to each. Some respect must be
shown to congregations too. If the clergy
claim on their side the right of independent
thought, which they are quite justified in
doing, the congregations on their side have
a much greater right to a consistent teaching,
which shall not distract their minds with
strange and unwonted forms of Christianity.</p>

<p>Mr. Ruskin, as he often does, is going <i>too
deep</i>. He asks for that which we shall never
see in this world,&mdash;the simple, pure religion of
the Bible to be taught in all singleness and
simplicity of mind by men whose only commission
is held from God, by or without the
channel of human authority, to show men,
women, and children the way "to the summit
of the celestial mountains," and to set an awful
warning by conspicuous beacons against the
"crevasses which go down quickest to the
pit." But who shall say that he is wrong?
Nay, rather, it is we that are wrong in resting
satisfied with our low views of things, while
Ruskin soars above our heads.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidelink"><a href="#III">Letter III</a></span></p>

<h4>On Letter III</h4>

<p>I would preface the few remarks I wish to
make upon this letter by an extract from a
letter just received from a dear good friend:</p>

<blockquote><p>"I have already read these deeply interesting
letters five times. They are like 'the
foam-globes of leaven.' I must say they have
exercised my mind very much. Things in
them which at first seem rather startling,
prove on closer examination to be full of deep
truth. The suggestions in them lead to 'great
searchings of heart.' There is much with
which I entirely agree; much over which to
ponder. What an insight into human nature
is shown in the remark that though we are
so ready to call ourselves 'miserable sinners'
we resent being accused of any special fault!</p>

<div class="rightsign">
"S. B."
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>By the side of this, it will be instructive,
though strange, if I place an extract from
another note from one whom I have long
known and highly esteemed; and it will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
seen what a singular "discerner of hearts"
and "divider of spirits" is this series of
letters:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"If they are really meant <i>au sérieux</i>, I could
not express any opinion of them without implying
a reflection upon you also, as you seem
to endorse them so fully. I prefer, therefore,
to say merely that, as a whole, they offer
one of the most remarkable instances I ever
met with of the old adage, 'Ne sutor ultra
crepidam.'"<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p></blockquote>



<p>In spite of this I retain all my old high
opinion of the writer of these lines, and feel convinced
that he will soon think very differently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, it is as my first correspondent has said,
"Things which at first seem startling, on
examination prove to be full of deep truth."
In the short compass of this <a href="#III">Letter III.</a> lies enfolded
a vast question, which, in the midst of
the friction and conflict of ages of strife, has
been shuffled away into odd corners, to be
brought out into life only now and then, when
a man is born into the world who sees what
few will even glance at, and who will say out
that which ought to be spoken, though but
few may listen. What is the question which
is put here so tersely and so pointedly? It is
this, which I am only putting a little differently,
not with the most distant idea of improving
upon Mr. Ruskin's felicitous touches; but,
because expressed in twofold fashion, what
has escaped one may strike another in a
different form.</p>

<p>Is a clergyman of the Church of England a
teacher of the doctrine and practice and discipline
of the Church of England within her
limits only, narrow as they are, when compared
with Christendom? or is there not
rather a wider, more comprehensive Church
yet&mdash;that of Christ upon earth&mdash;which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
must serve, which he must preach, in forgetfulness
of the limited boundaries within which
by his education and his ordination vows he
is <i>apparently</i> bound to remain? Is there not
enough of Christianity common to all the
Christian nations upon earth, and which ought
to be made the subject of teaching to the
ignorant and the castaway? Is it quite a
right thing that the natives of Madagascar, for
instance, should see parties of missionaries
arriving amongst them: one, in all the gorgeous
trappings and with all the elaborate ritual
of Rome; another in rusty black coats and
hats and dirty white neckties, repudiating all
but the very barest necessary ceremonial; a
third, possibly disunited in itself, coming as
High Churchmen or Low Churchmen, with
differing peculiarities? Is this an edifying spectacle
for the Malagasy? And can the Gospel
be preached as effectually in this highly diversified
fashion as it would be with the simplicity
of a reasonable and just sufficiently elastic
uniformity?</p>

<p>Coming before many people of infinite
diversity of mind, it cannot be doubted that
Christianity must necessarily take a variety of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
forms, to suit different intelligences, and adapt
itself to differing situations. But in all this
large variety of forms of religion, ranging
from mere paganism at one end, just a little
unavoidably altered by the contact of Christianity,
and at the other extremity a pure
religion, but refined and intellectual, I do not
see exactly what is the form of Christianity
which the Church of England is to preach to
the masses at home and abroad. As long as
England takes the Gospel to the ignorant in
such infinitely diversified forms, it is as if an
incapable general were to divide his forces
preparatory to an assault upon a compact and
well-defended stronghold.</p>

<p>It is enough to make one weep with vexation
and humiliation to see what sort of religion
would be presented to the world if some
who claim to have all truth on their side could
have their own way. I say to have the truth
on their side,&mdash;which is a very different thing
from being on the side of truth. There is
even a new religion&mdash;for it is certainly not the
old&mdash;growing popular with "thinkers," who
write and read in the three great half-crown
monthlies, which is evolved in the most curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
variety out of their inner consciousness by
religion-makers, whose fertile brains are the
only soil that can bring forth such productions.
What is the vast uneducated world to do with
these extraordinary forms of religion which
are as many-sided and many-faced as their
inventors?</p>

<p>Now Mr. Ruskin and many others see this
state of things with pity and compassion, and
ask, "Cannot this Gospel of Christ be put
into such plain words and short terms as that
a plain man may understand it?" Why is
there no such easy summary provided by
authority to teach the poor and simple? The
Apostles' Creed is good for its own end and
purpose, but it requires great expansion to
be made to include Gospel teaching, and
it contains nothing practical. The Thirty-nine
Articles are not even intended (as Mr.
Ruskin by some oversight seems to think
they are) to be a summary of the Gospel.
We have no concise and plain, clear and
intelligible form of sound words to answer
this most important end. The Church Catechism,
from old associations, belongs to
childhood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span></p>

<p>Every reasonable person must agree with
Mr. Ruskin, that there could be no harm, but
much good, in Christians making a little less
of their Churchmanship, and a little more of
their broad Christianity.</p>


<p><span class="sidelink"><a href="#IV">Letter IV</a></span></p>

<h4>On Letter IV</h4>

<p>Mr. Ruskin pleads in this letter with touching
eloquence for the guidance of the law of
love, that irresistible law, one effect of which
is to give to the highest probability the force
of a sufficient certainty, and establishes in
the man the mental habit best described as
<i>certitude</i>.</p>

<p>In Cardinal Newman's "History of My
Religious Opinions," p. 18, he quotes some
beautiful passages from Keble's conversations
with himself (disagreeing with him all the
time), in which he had quoted, "I will guide
thee <i>with mine eye</i>" (Psalm xxxii. 8), as the
expression of the gentle suasive power that
directs the steps of the child and friend of
God, as distinguished from "the bit and bridle"
laid upon horse and mule, who represent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
unwilling slaves recognising no law but that
of force or coercion. It is an Eye whose gaze
is ever fixed on us, the "Eye of God's Word,"
"like that of a portrait uniformly fixed on us,
turn where we will."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> And Keble is right so
far as concerns the true children and friends
of God, subject, as their highest control, to
the law of love. Pure and exalted minds ever
strain for, and yearn after, a general and outward
manifestation of the witness that man
is "the image and glory of God" (1 Cor.
xi. 7).</p>



<p>Unhappily, we are not so constituted by
nature. The inroads and ravages of sin are
but too evident, as well in those upon whom
episcopal hands have been laid, as in the ranks
of the laity. Are not wilfulness and pride of
intellect and glorification of self ever exercising
such a power in the earth, that checks
and restraints are found absolutely necessary
to curb and control the determination of many
of the ministers of the Church not only to
<i>think</i> as seems good to them (which they have
a perfect right to do), but openly to <i>teach and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
to preach</i> whatever doctrines they may have
conceived in their own minds, or have learnt
from others, contrary to the received doctrines
of the Church of England; which they
have no right to do as long as they remain
ministers of the Church whose doctrines they
impugn?</p>

<p>Mr. Ruskin correctly assumes that the terms
of the Lord's Prayer, being in the very words
of Christ, do contain a body of Divine doctrine;
and they would be the fittest to adopt as a
standard of Christian teaching, <i>if</i> only all men
were as candid, sincere, and straightforward
as himself. But because there is no certainty
that any large and preponderating body of men
will exhibit these graces of Christianity in
themselves, and combine with them gentleness,
tolerance, and forbearance, therefore
they <i>must</i> be held in "with bit and bridle,"&mdash;that
is, with Articles and Creeds and declarations,&mdash;"lest
they fall upon thee," and
fill the Church more full of sedition, disaffection,
and disquiet than it already is.</p>

<p>Cardinal Newman himself is an example of
the necessity of the restraints of creeds, as
well, indeed, as of their general inefficiency to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
maintain unity. His "History of my Religious
Opinions," at least in its beginning,
is but the story of a long succession of phases
of belief and disbelief, originating in&mdash;what?
In study of the Word of God? in Divine
contemplation, or in devout and thoughtful
meditation? No, indeed; but in walks and
conversations, now with one friend, now with
another, now round the Quadrangle of Oriel,
then in Christ Church meadows; in fanciful,
and apparently causeless, changes in his own
mind, of which sometimes he can give the
exact date, sometimes he has forgotten it, but
which lead him out of one set of opinions
into another in a helpless kind of way, as if
he knew of no motive power but the influence
of other men's minds or the momentary and
fitful fluctuations of a spirit ever too much
given to introspection to maintain a steady
and uniform course.</p>

<p>What a contrast between the downright,
manly straightforwardness of a Ruskin and
the fluttering, uncertain flights of a Newman,
ending in the cold, dead fixity of the Roman
faith, whereof to doubt is to be damned!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidelink"><a href="#V">Letter V</a></span></p>

<h4>On Letter V</h4>


<p>The next paragraph to the last in this letter,
contains a statement which at first might seem
to be rashly expressed. But I was not long
in apprehending that when Mr. Ruskin alludes
to a scheme of pardon "for which we are supposed
to be thankful, not to the Father, but to
the Son," he was far from impugning that
doctrine of the Atonement in which, as it is
generally understood among Christian people,
the whole plan of salvation centres.</p>

<p>But there seems to have been a fatality
about this sentence. Numbers have read it
and commented upon it, myself amongst the
number, as if Mr. Ruskin were here expressing
<i>his own view</i>; instead of which, he is here
quoting other men's opinions, to condemn
them with severity. The <i>Record</i> called it
some of Mr. Ruskin's dross; but it is other
people's dross, for which he would offer us
pure gold.</p>

<p>I happened, a very short time previous to
receiving this letter, to have had my attention
attracted by the following passage of Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
Ruskin's own:&mdash;"When, in the desert, He
was girding Himself for the work of life,
angels of life came and ministered to Him;
now, in the fair world, when He is girding
Himself for the work of death [at the Transfiguration],
the ministrants came to Him from
the grave. But from the grave conquered.
One from that tomb under Abarim, which
His own hand had sealed long ago; the
other from the rest which He had entered
without seeing corruption."</p>

<p>Pleased with the truthful eloquence of this
passage, I placed it at the head of the chapter
on the Transfiguration in my book on the
Life and Work of Christ (still in the press).
Having done so, it struck me that Mr. Ruskin,
whether intentionally or undesignedly, had
made the pronoun "His" to apply either to
God the Father, or to God the Son. It may
grammatically refer to either. From this I
drew the conclusion which I expressed in a
short letter to my friend, that, discarding the
strictly human uses of language, which, from
its unavoidable poverty, lacks the power of
marking the true nature of the difference
between the Divine Persons of the Holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
Trinity, he had spoken of the Father and of
the Son indiscriminately or indifferently, <i>i.e.</i>,
without a difference.</p>

<p>And so it really is. How shall a man,
though at the highest he be "but a little
lower than the angels," know and comprehend
the Godhead in its true and exact nature?
The names father and son express an earthly
relation perfectly well understood when belonging
to ourselves, but when applied to
the Supreme Divine Being, they must of
necessity fall far short of expressing their
true connexion with one another. They are,
when applied to Heavenly beings, merely
anthropomorphic terms used in compassion
to our infirmities, and conveying to us only
an approximation to the ideas intended. We
say the Father sent the Son; the Son suffered
for our sins. But since Father and Son are
One, we are plainly expressing something
short of the exact state of the case when we
speak of our thankfulness to the Son as if
we had no reason to be equally thankful to
the Father.</p>

<p>The Athanasian Creed makes no great demand
upon our mental powers when it requires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
of us, in speaking of the Trinity, neither to
confound the Persons nor to divide the Substance;
for, in truth, I suppose we are equally
incapable of doing either.</p>

<p>These are Divine matters, of which, while
the simplest may know enough, the wisest
can never fathom the whole depth. For the
Divine power and love, knowledge and compassion,
will never be fully comprehended
until we know even as we are known.</p>

<p>But, as I am abstaining from questioning
Mr. Ruskin as to his meaning in any passage,
if it happens to be slightly obscure, awaiting
his reply at the close of the book, I may here
say that I believe that this sentence refers to
a wild and unscriptural kind of preaching,
happily becoming less common, in which undue
stress is laid upon the wrathfulness of
God, as contrasted with the mercy of the
Saviour, as if we had only the Son to thank,
and not our loving Father in Heaven, for the
blessed hope of eternal life. Some there are,
and always will be, who habitually err in not
rightly dividing the Word of God, and giving
undue prominence to a dark portion of doctrine,
which is true enough in itself, but would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
relieved of much of its gloom, if due prominence
were given to other parts of the truth
of God.</p>

<p>I do not mean to praise caution at the
expense of courage. I have a constitutional
aversion to that caution allied to timidity and
cowardice which prompts a man to look to
his safety, comfort, and worldly repute as
the first social law that concerns <i>him</i>. I
admire rather the brave man who is ready
to sacrifice all that, if he can, by so doing,
gain the desired right end.</p>

<p>But in the case before us, it is not so.
Men talk as if all we had to do to convert
a sinner from the error of his way was to
give him a good talking, forgetting that we
have not a plastic material to work upon, but
a most stubborn and intractable one, wherever
interest is concerned; and that a bold bad
man is generally proof against talk, and yields
to no power but the grace of God exercised
directly, and seconded by His heavy judgments.
Have we not all seen, with shame
and astonishment, the "wicked rich" regularly
in their places at church, much oftener
than the "wicked poor," who have less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
interest in playing the hypocrite? And have
we not felt our utter powerlessness, whether
by public preaching or by private monition,
to find a way to those case-hardened hearts?
What are we to do with such a man as
Tennyson describes in "Sea Dreams," who</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>
<p>
<span class="sidelink"><a href="#VI">Letter VI</a></span>
</p>



<h4>On Letter VI</h4>

<p>As is the manner of our friend, he concludes
a letter which was begun with thoughtful
wisdom, with a proposal which, if gravely
made, will seem to most of us both unpractical
and impracticable.</p>

<p>Very forcible and very true is the emphatic
declaration here made of the deep, perhaps
unpardonable sinfulness of taking in vain the
holy name of God.</p>

<p>But, to my mind, the irremediable fault
in the latter proposition in this letter is the
assumption that every honest clergyman of
average capacity, and of ordinary experience
of life, is, of course, wise enough to discern
men's characters and to judge them with that
unerring sagacity that will enable him to pronounce
without favour or distinction of persons
the severe sentence: "You shall not enter this
house of God. I interdict your presence here.
The comforts and privileges of religion are for
other than thou. I deny thee the prayers, the
preaching, and the sacraments of the Church."
More briefly&mdash;"I excommunicate thee."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span></p>

<p>Even in the case of a very bad man this
would be found impossible to accomplish without
the direst danger to the clergyman's usefulness
and influence, to say nothing of his
peace. For our experience abundantly shows
that let a bad man but be audacious, and even
ruffianly enough, helped by his position, he
will always find plenty of support among the
powerful and influential. The poor and honest
clergyman, if he has attempted to enforce
Church discipline, will be gravely rebuked for
his want of charity, for his sad lack of discretion
or tact, for his utter want of worldly
wisdom; he will very soon find, to use the
familiar phrase, the place too hot for him, and
he may be thankful if he escapes with some
small remainder of respect or compassion from
the nobler-minded of his flock, who are always
in a very small minority.</p>

<p>I know not how it really was in the time
when the rubrics of the Communion Services
were framed. One would think, judging from
these, that the clergyman possessed unlimited
power to judge and punish with spiritual deprivation,
and that he was alone to unite in
himself all the various offices of accuser and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
police, counsel, jury, and judge. We are required
to say every Ash Wednesday that we
regret the loss of the godly discipline of the
Primitive Church&mdash;under which, "at the beginning
of Lent, all such persons as stood
convicted of notorious sin were put to open
penance; and that it is much to be wished
that the said discipline may be restored
again." But few can seriously view a realization
of that wish without fear for the certain
consequences.</p>

<p>The truth is, the world moves on. Human
nature may remain the same; but the laws
and usages of society are subject to changes
which it is useless to withstand. At the
present day, great, rather too great, perhaps,
are the claims of <i>charity</i>. We are told to
hope for the best in the worst of cases; we
are to forgive all, even the still hardened and
unrepenting; we are to smile upon heresy
and schism; we are to treat the rude, the
churlish, the hard of heart, amidst our flocks,
as if we had the greatest regard for them! I
am not prepared to say that this is in every
way to be regretted; for these are errors
that lean perhaps to virtue's side.  But I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
certainly do think that often a little more
fearlessness in rebuking vice would not come
amiss.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, suppose for a
moment the clergy to have the undisputed
power to bar out both the wicked rich and the
wicked poor from their churches, this power
would be of very little use; nay, it would be full
of mischief and danger, without a sound judgment,
a fearless spirit, and a heart little used
to the melting mood. The clergy, as a class,
may perhaps be a trifle superior to the laity in
moral character, in spiritual knowledge, and
in judgment in dealing with people, because
their profession has early trained (or at any
rate, ought to have trained) them in the constant
and imperative exercise of self-examination
and self-control, and the careful discernment
of character in their intercourse with
men. But that superiority, if it exists at all,
is so trifling as to make very little impression
on the laity, who would naturally be ready
at any step to dispute the wisdom or expediency
of the judicial acts of the clergy.</p>

<p>Further, again: given both the wisdom to
judge and the power to doom, would it be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
desirable to establish a rule that the open and
notorious sinner (though there would always
be differences of opinion upon what he really
is, even among the clergy themselves) should
be prevented from coming where he might,
above all other places, be most likely to hear
words that would touch his heart and bring
him to a better mind? From the pulpit, words
of counsel, of holy doctrine, and of heart-stirring
precepts of the Gospel, fall with a power
and weight which are rarely to be found in
private conversations. Many an open and
notorious sinner has first yielded up his heart
to God under the powerful influence of preaching.
When Jesus sat in the Pharisee's house,
all the publicans and sinners drew near to
hear Him; and the orthodox sinners, the
Pharisees, made bitter complaints that He received
and ate with the scorned and rejected
sinners. God forbid that the day should ever
come when spiritual pride and exclusiveness
shall shut out even the hardest of sinners from
the house of God; for who can tell where or
when the word may be spoken which shall
break the stony heart, and replace it with the
tender heart of flesh, soon to be filled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
love and devotion to God the Saviour and
Redeemer?</p>

<p>But, as this is a subject of great importance,
may I also say a word in support
of Mr. Ruskin's own view that the wicked
should be discouraged, or even forbidden, to
enter the house of God? We have 2 Cor. vi.
14-18, which seems to point out that, in the
primitive Church, the wicked were not allowed
in the assemblies of the faithful. And we
remember David's "I have hated the congregation
of evil doers, and will not sit with the
wicked" (Psalm xxvi. 5). Is not Mr. Ruskin,
perhaps, after all, only advocating a return to
primitive usage?</p>

<p>Mr. Ruskin says in the Preface to his
selected works: "What I wrote on religion
was painstaking, and I think forcible, as compared
with most religious writing; especially
in its frankness and fearlessness." Unfortunately
he adds, "But it was wholly mistaken."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
He is still equally outspoken, frank,
and fearless; but what he wrote upon religion,
as far as I know it, in the days which he now
condemns, will live and do good, as long as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
the noble English language, of which he is
one of the greatest masters, lives to convey to
distant generations the great thoughts of the
sons that are her proudest boast.</p>



<h5>Additional Remarks on the Censures
of the Church.</h5>

<h6>By the Editor.</h6>

<p>Since writing my notes on <a href="#VI">Letter VI.</a>, in
which Mr. Ruskin gives such vehement expression
to his desire to see the ancient discipline
of the Church restored, I have in
conversation with himself learned this to be
one of the objects he has most at heart in
writing these letters; and I have also read in
the Life of Bishop Selwyn, by the Rev. H. W.
Tucker (vol. i., p. 241) that admirable prelate's
view of this disregarded question. I believe
Selwyn to have been the greatest uninspired
missionary since the days of St. Paul (if indeed
we can with truth consider so great a man
wholly uninspired). But the great Bishop of
the South Seas, in the charge from which
copious extracts are there given, distinctly
recommends the revival of spiritual discipline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
and the censures of the Church upon unrepenting
offenders. He refers for authority to
apostolic example and precept, and to the
discipline rubrics of the Communion Service,
and adds the undeniable fact that our Anglican
communion is the only branch of the Christian
Church where such discipline is wanting.</p>

<p>I must ask leave to refer my readers to Mr.
Tucker's book for the grounds in detail of the
Bishop's wishes. I am not aware that any
English prelate has ventured upon so hazardous
an experiment; one, I should rather say, so
certain to fail disastrously. The infancy of
the Christian Church, and the Divine guidance
directly exercised, rendered such discipline in
the first centuries both practicable and effective.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
But I do not remember that any
parish priest of the Reformed Church has ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
attempted to enforce the Communion rubrics,
except, as we have learned from the public
papers, in recent times, with disastrous consequences
to the promoters. And what kind of
wickedness is to be so visited? To prove
drunkenness, or impurity, or fraudulent practices,
or false doctrine (Canon 109), a judicial
inquiry must be resorted to. Rebukes for
lesser offences would certainly lead to disputes,
if not even to recrimination! The irresistible
circumstances of the age would entirely defeat
any such endeavours. In towns, parochial
limits are practically unknown or ignored, and
families, or individuals, attend whatever church
or chapel they please, no one preventing them,
thus making all exercise of sacerdotal authority
impracticable. In the country, even where
only the parish church is within reach, it is
highly probable that an offender would meet
priestly excommunication by the easy expedient
of cutting himself off from communication with
his clergyman and his church; and even if he
did not, it would be a very new state of things
if the sentence were received with submission
on the part of the offender, and acquiescence
on that of the congregation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>In short, the thing is simply impossible;
and I do not find that even Bishop Selwyn
himself visited immorality with ecclesiastical
censures, or supported his clergy in doing so;
and I am using the word "immorality" in its
full and proper sense, and not with that restricted
meaning which confines it to a particular
sin. It is true, as he says, that our
Church stands alone in refraining from the
exercise of such power. But in other religious
bodies, the discretionary power to use such
dangerous weapons is not left to individuals
however gifted. It rests in a constituted body,
on whom the whole responsibility would lie.
But the isolation of the English clergyman in
his church and parish forbids him thus to risk
his whole usefulness and his social existence.
Who would confirm him in his judgment?
Who would stand by him in the troubles
which he would assuredly entail upon himself?
Would his churchwardens, his rural dean, his
archdeacon, or his bishop? I think there
would be little comfort to be found in any of
these quarters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="sidelink"><a href="#VII">Letter VII</a></span>
</p>


<h4>On Letter VII</h4>

<p>Excellent as is <a href="#From_the_Rev_Canon_Gray">Canon Gray's letter</a> (p. <a href="#Page_169">169</a>),
I do not at all concur in his somewhat severe
censure on the second paragraph in this letter,
in which Mr. Ruskin, as I conceive, with complete
theological accuracy, points out how in
His human nature our Lord accepted and received
some, perhaps many, of the deficiencies
of our nature, human frailty and weakness,
even human <i>liability</i> to sin, without, however,
once yielding to its temptations. I have everywhere
in my "Life of Christ" endeavoured to
give reasons for my faith in this view, which,
even if held, I know is not often professed.</p>

<p>If Christ had been perfectly insensible to
the allurements of sin, where would be His
fellow-feeling with us? It would be a mere
outward semblance; nor would there then be
any significance in the statement that "He
was in all points tempted like as we are," if
He had been able to view with calm indifference
the inducements presented to Him from
time to time to abandon His self-sacrificing
work and consult His safety. The captain is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
not to go securely armour-plated into the
fight while the private soldier marches in
his usual unprotected apparel. Nor will
the Captain of our salvation protect Himself
against the dangers which He invites us to
encounter. If He knew nothing of sin from
experience of its power, how could He be
an example to us? Therefore I believe Mr.
Ruskin to be perfectly right in affirming that
in the words of Jesus we listen not to one
speaking entirely in the Power and Wisdom
of God, but to the Son of Man, bowed down,
but not conquered, by afflictions, firm and
unbending in His great purpose to bear in
His own body the sin of the world&mdash;Son of
Man, yet God Incarnate.</p>

<p>Nor does it seem to me "a hard way of
speaking" when Mr. Ruskin rightly and
plainly affirms the perfect humanity of Christ,
which, however, Canon Gray correctly points
out to be assumed and borne in accordance
with His own will as perfect God. I am
afraid that, good and kind as he is, it is
Canon Gray himself who is a little hard in
unconsciously imputing thoughts which had
no existence in the writer's mind!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span></p>

<p>I cannot help being amused at the gravity
with which certain critics shake their heads
ominously over the last paragraph in this
letter, and seriously ask, What can Mr.
Ruskin mean by the "peace and joy in the
Holy Ghost" enjoyed by the birds? The
Poet Laureate would hardly care to be
brought to book for each poetical flight with
which he charms his many appreciative
readers, and to be asked to explain exactly
what he means by each of those noble
thoughts which are only revealed from soul
to soul, and dissolve into fluid, like the beautiful
brittle-star of our coasts, under the touch
of a too curious hand.</p>

<p>How do we know but that the animal
existence of these charming companions of
our quiet hours is not accompanied by a
spiritual existence too, as much inferior to
our own spiritual state as their corporeal to
ours? And therefore shall we boldly dare
to say that they perish altogether and for
ever? We may neither believe nor disbelieve
in matters kept so completely secret from us.
But we must be pardoned for leaning to a
belief that the feathered creatures which spend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
most of their brief life in singing loud praises
to the loving Creator and Giver of all good,
do not live quite for nothing beyond the
dissolution of their little frames. There are
no means of ascertaining this by scientific
experiments, or even by the most ingenious
processes of induction carefully recorded and
duly referred to as occasion may arise. But
certainly it is a harmless fancy which many
have indulged in before Mr. Ruskin, without
being charged with such unsoundness in
doctrine as denying the Personality of the
Holy Ghost! By-and-by it may be found
that what men have believed in half in sport
will be realized wholly in earnest. Just
outside the churchyard wall of Ecclesfield
may be seen (at least I saw it a few years
ago) a little monumental stone to a favourite
dog, with the text, "Thou, Lord, preservest
man and beast." And in Kingsley's "Prose
Idylls" I have just met most <i>àpropos</i> with
the following beautiful passage, which many
will read with pleasure, perhaps some with
profit:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"If anyone shall hint to us that we and the birds
may have sprung originally from the same type; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
the difference between our intellect and theirs is one
of degree, and not of kind, we may believe or doubt:
but in either case we shall not be greatly moved.
'So much the better for the birds,' we will say, 'and
none the worse for us. You raise the birds towards
us: but you do not lower us towards them.' What we
are, we are by the grace of God. Our own powers
and the burden of them we know full well. It does
not lessen their dignity or their beauty in our eyes
to hear that the birds of the air partake, even a little,
of the same gifts of God as we. Of old said St.
Guthlac in Crowland, as the swallows sat upon his
knee, 'He who leads his life according to the will of
God, to him the wild deer and the wild birds draw
more near;' and this new theory of yours may prove
St. Guthlac right. St. Francis, too&mdash;he called the
birds his brothers. Whether he was correct, either
theologically or zoologically, he was plainly free from
that fear of being mistaken for an ape, which haunts
so many in these modern times. Perfectly sure that
he himself was a spiritual being, he thought it at least
possible that birds might be spiritual beings likewise,
incarnate like himself in mortal flesh; and saw no
degradation to the dignity of human nature in claiming
kindred lovingly with creatures so beautiful, so
wonderful, who (as he fancied in his old-fashioned
way) praised God in the forest, even as angels did
in heaven. In a word, the saint, though he was
an ascetic, and certainly no man of science, was
yet a poet, and somewhat of a philosopher; and
would possibly&mdash;so do extremes meet&mdash;have hailed as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
orthodox, while we hail as truly scientific, Wordsworth's
great saying&mdash;</p>

<span class="sidelink"><a href="#VIII">Letter VIII</a></span>
</p>

<h4>On Letter VIII</h4>

<p>What generous and enlightened spirit will
not be stirred to its innermost depths by
these words, burning as they are with a
well-grounded indignation?</p>

<p>I dare say some of the clergy will have a
word to say on their claim to the priesthood
as implying a sacrificial and mediatorial character.
On this point I will say nothing at
present.</p>

<p>But it is an awfully solemn consideration
put before us here, whether instead of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
pure blessings and the bright countenances
intended to be ours, our accursed blessings
and defiled faces are not the natural consequences
of our wilful misunderstanding of
what the will of the Lord is.</p>

<p>"Thy will be done" is a petition which
can be offered up in two quite distinct senses.
In the one, it is an expression of resignation
to the Father's afflictive dispensations; in the
other, the heartfelt desire to work out the
revealed will of God in all the many-sided
aspects of life. In the first sense, when
sorrow or death has entered our door, our
first impulse, if we are Christians, is to give
evidence of, and expression to, our resignation
by recognizing the <i>will of God</i>. Hence
Mr. Ruskin interposes: "Are you so sure
that it <i>was</i> the will of God that your child
should die, or that you should have got into
that trouble?" I look in my local paper
in the column of deaths, and see in a neighbouring
large town how extraordinary a proportion
of deaths are those of children. I
have taken occasional cemetery duty in one
of the busiest centres of industry in Yorkshire,
and was shocked at the large numbers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
of funerals in white. Am I to believe it was
the <i>will of God</i> that so many young children
should perish, especially as I look to my own
beautiful parish, with its sweet sea and mountain
breezes mingled, where the deaths of
children are comparatively rare? and am I
not forced to believe that, even without the
assistance of destitution&mdash;neglect and overcrowding,
and "quieting mixtures" and ardent
spirits, and kicks and blows have filled most
of those little graves? I fear that the will
of Satan is here being accomplished vastly
to his satisfaction. And seldom does the
Government do more than touch the fringe
of these monstrous evils. Of course they say
"We cannot interfere," or "Legislation in
these matters is impracticable." But can we
not all remember when it was just as certain
that free trade in food was impracticable? but
who does not see that it is saving us from
famine this dark year 1879?&mdash;that compulsory
education was revolutionary and full of
unimaginable perils to the country, and yet who
are so glad as the poor themselves, now that
it has been carried into effect? It used to be
thought that if people chose to kill themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
with unwholesome open drains before their
doors, there was no power able to prevent them.
But we are wiser now. Legislators have generally
been, or chosen to appear, like cowards
till the time for action came, very late, and then
they were decided enough. Now let us hope
that a way may be found to save infant life from
premature extinction by wholesale.</p>

<p>Let me use this opportunity of saying that
in the letters we are now considering there is
a feature which ought not to escape those who
are desirous of deriving good from them; and
that is that in their very condensed form no
time is taken for explanation or expansion.
Mr. Ruskin speaks as unto wise men, and
asks us to judge for ourselves what he says.
But my own experience, after frequent perusal
of them, shows me that there is a vast
fund of truth in them which becomes apparent
only after patient consideration and reflection.
Without desiring at all to bestow extravagant
praise on my kind friend, or any other distinguished
man, it is only fair and just to own
that the truth that is in these letters shines
out more and more the more closely they are
examined.  It is a gift that God has given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
him, which has cost him far more pain, worry,
and vexation, through all kinds of wilful and
envious, as well as innocent and unconscious
misrepresentation, than ever it has gained him
of credit or renown.</p>

<p>This principle leads me to view <i>now</i> with
approbation what I could not read at first
without an unpleasant feeling. The sentence:
"Nearly the whole Missionary body (with
the hottest Evangelical section of the English
Church) is at this moment composed of men
who think the Gospel they are to carry to mend
the world with, forsooth, is this, 'If any man
sin, he hath an Advocate with the Father.'"
And when I first read it to my reverend
brethren, hard words were spoken of this passage,
because in its terseness, in its elliptic
form, it easily allows itself to be misunderstood.
Yet the paragraph contains the essence
of the Gospel expressed with a faithful boldness
not often met with in pulpit addresses.</p>

<p>"If any man sin, we have an Advocate with
the Father." We have here a solemn and
momentous truth, expressed in few words, as
clearly and as briefly as any geometrical definition.
But is this <i>all</i> the Gospel? Will this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
alone "mend the world, forsooth"? Now the
extreme men of one particular school in the
English Church do really preach little else
beside this. When they are entreated to
preach upon good works, too, and unfold a
little of their value and beauty,&mdash;if they have
any at all,&mdash;the answer is always to the effect,
"Oh, of course; faith in Christ must of necessity
beget the love of good works. These are
the signs of that. Preach Christ crucified,
and all the rest will be sure to follow." And
this is what is exclusively called "preaching
the Gospel." The preacher who teaches us
to love our enemies, to live pure lives, to be
honourable to all men and women, to bring
up our families in the truth, is frowned upon
as a "legal preacher." As a clergyman myself,
I am not afraid of saying that I look upon
this so-called Gospel-preaching as fraught with
not a little of danger. God knows, wicked
sinners are found in every congregation and
class of men, kneeling to pray, and singing
praises, exactly like good men. Now I can
hardly conceive a style and matter of preaching
more calculated to excuse and palliate,
and almost encourage sin, than this narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
and exclusive so-called Gospel-preaching.
Neither Christ nor His apostles taught thus
at all. The whole Sermon on the Mount is
moral in the highest and purest sense. Every
epistle has its moral or <i>legal</i> side. "Woe is
me if I preach not the Gospel!" and I cannot
be preaching the Gospel unless, along with
the great proclamation, "If any man sin, we
have an Advocate with the Father," I also do
my utmost to teach "what the will of the
Lord is" concerning a pure, holy, and blameless
life, full of active, good works, done in
deep humility and self-abasement; because
Christ loved me and died for me, and asks
me, in love to Him, to walk in His steps.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidelink"><a href="#IX">Letter IX</a></span>
</p>

<h4>On Letter IX</h4>

<p>I fancy I can still hear the murmur of angry
dissent pass round as I read to my reverend
brethren this indignant plea for a higher interpretation
of the petition for daily bread than
that which passes current with the unthinking,
self-indulgent world. Nevertheless, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
manifestation of feeling was not general, and
I thoroughly agree with Mr. Ruskin that the world
has, from the first, used this prayer
thoughtlessly and blasphemously; and probably
will continue to do so to the end, when
the thoughts and imaginations of all men's
hearts shall be revealed, and no more disguises
shall be possible; when the masked
hypocrite's smile shall be torn from him and
reveal the covetousness that breeds in his
heart to its core; when the honourable man
shall no longer be confounded with thieves,
nor the usurer and extortioner be courted and
bowed to like an honest man.</p>

<p>The veil that hid the true Christ, as Mr.
Ruskin has well remarked, was removed in
the breaking of bread with the disciples at
Emmaus. As the Master, so the true disciples.
They too may be known both by the
spiritual breaking of the Bread of Life in the
Holy Communion (though the canting hypocrite
too may be found polluting that holy
rite); but more especially in the union of
the sacred ordinance with obedience to the
scarcely less sacred command of Christian love
and charity to the poor. There may be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
empty profession, but there will be none of
the reality of the religion of the Gospel, unless
we are partakers of the bread broken at the
Lord's Table, or unless we eat the bread
earned by the honest labour of our hands or
of our brains, or share some of our bread with
those, the Lord's brethren, whom He has left
for us to care for in His name. The absence
of either of these three essential conditions
just lays us open to the charge of flaunting
before the world a false and spurious Christianity.
In the plain words of our friend, our
bread not being fairly got or fairly used, is
stolen bread.</p>

<p>But I would willingly believe that it is only
by a strong figure of speech that we clergy
are here again emphatically called upon to
act the part of inquisitors by pointedly demanding
of every member of our flock a
precise account of the manner in which he
earns his livelihood. Still, if the answer was
not a surprised and indignant stare, I believe
the great mass of men would probably be able
to give an answer which should abundantly
satisfy themselves and us, until Mr. Ruskin
threw his own light upon the answer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
demonstrated that the notions of modern
civilized society are not in accordance with
the highest teaching. According to our ideas,
the artisan, the tradesman, the merchant, the
members of the learned and the military and
naval professions, all those engaged in the
various departments of government work, from
the cabinet minister down to the last office
clerk,&mdash;all these use the labour of body or of
mind, and in return receive the necessaries or
the luxuries of life for themselves and their
households. Men who are, if they please,
exempt altogether from such labour, as large
landed proprietors, are certainly under a
temptation to lead a life of ease and leisure.
But it is very seldom that we are offended
with the sight of a landlord so unmindful of
social duties as to take no personal active
interest in the welfare and conduct of his
tenants, or forgetful of the responsibilities to
his country imposed upon him by his rank
and position.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that Mr. Ruskin does not
in all solemn seriousness really expect that
after a fair examination of the modes of life
of all these people, "an entirely new view of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
life and its sacraments will open upon us and
them." Is it indeed a fact that "the great
mass of men calling themselves Christians do
actually live by robbing the poor of their bread,
and by no other trade whatsoever"? Mr.
Ruskin is always terribly in earnest in whatever
he says, and we must look for an explanation
of this sentence in the very decided
views he holds upon interest of money, which
he calls usury.</p>

<p>Mr. Ruskin classes Usury and Interest together.
Here are some of his strong words
upon this subject: "There is absolutely no
debate possible as to what usury is, any more
than what adultery is. The Church has only
been polluted by indulgence in it since the
16th century. Usury is any kind whatever
of interest on loan, and it is the essential
modern force of Satan." This was written
September 9th of this year. In "Fors Clavigera,"
Letter lxxxii., p. 323, he challenged
the Bishop of Manchester to answer him the
question, whether he considered "usury to be
a work of the Lord"?<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> In the same letter,
to place his heavy denunciation against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
wickedness of usury in the best possible
company, he pleads: "Plato's scheme was
impossible even in his own day,&mdash;as Bacon's
New Atlantis in <i>his</i> day,&mdash;as Calvin's reform
in <i>his</i> day,&mdash;as Goethe's Academe in his; but
of the good there was in all these men, the
world gathered what it could find of evil."</p>


<p>Let us look a little closer into this matter.
It is not because a man with fearless frankness
breasts the full torrent of popular persuasion
and universal practice that he is to
be thrust aside as a fanatic, with hard words
and unfeeling sneers concerning his sanity.
Here, again, I avow my persuasion that Mr.
Ruskin is, in one sense, too far in advance,
and, in another, too far in the rear of the
time; and while I attempt an explanatory justification
of the modern practice, I admit that
it is only "for the hardness of our hearts"
and because the golden age is still far off.</p>

<p>The Mosaic law was severe against usury
and increase, forbidding it under heavy threatenings
among the faithful Israelites, but allowing
it in lending to strangers. "If thy brother
be waxen poor, then thou shalt relieve him
... take thou no usury of him, or increase"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
(Lev. xxv. 35, 36). "Thou shalt not lend upon
usury to thy brother; usury of money, usury
of victuals, usury of anything that is lent upon
usury. <i>Unto a stranger</i> thou mayest lend
upon usury; but unto thy brother thou shalt
not lend upon usury" (Deut. xxiii. 19, 20).
"Lord, who shall abide in Thy tabernacle?
... He that putteth not out his money to
usury" (Psalm xv. 1, 5. See Ezek. xviii. 7,
etc.) And to come to the Christian law, we
have the mild general principle: "If ye lend
to them of whom ye hope to receive, what
thank have ye? for sinners also lend to
sinners, to receive as much again....
Lend, hoping for nothing again, and your
reward shall be great" (Luke vi. 34, 35).</p>

<p>So far the Law of Moses and the Gospel.</p>

<p>But our Lord, in the Parable of the Talents,
appears to actually sanction the practice of
loans upon interest: "Thou oughtest, therefore,
to have put my money to the exchangers,
and then at my coming I should have received
mine own with usury" (Matt. xxv. 27). The
preceding verse, the 26th, may well be understood
to be a question&mdash;Didst thou indeed
think so? It does not even indirectly attribute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
hardness and oppression to our Lord.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> I
am quite aware that it may be replied that
this is an instance of those strong audacious
metaphors, where the fact used by way of
illustration is instinctively overleaped by the
mind of the hearer to arrive at the lesson
which it marks and emphasizes; as when the
Lord is represented as an unjust judge, or
Paul speaks of grafting the wild olive branch
upon the good, or James refers to the rust
and canker upon gold and silver, or Milton
speaks of certain bishops as "blind mouths."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
But in all these cases, the hyperbole is manifest;
it is an untruth or a disguise, which
not only does not deceive, but teaches a great
truth. Our Lord's reference to money-lenders
or exchangers appears to lend an indirect
sanction to a familiar practice.</p>


<p>The Law of Moses, therefore, rebuking the
practice of lending for increase among brethren
and encouraging it in dealing with strangers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
combined with the well-known avarice of
the Jews to make them money-lenders on a
large scale, and at high rates of interest, to
the prodigals and spendthrifts, the bankrupt
barons and needy sovereigns of the middle
ages. Money was rarely lent for commercial
purposes, and to advance the real prosperity
of the borrower. It was generally to stave off
want for the time; and principal and interest,
when pay-day came, had generally to be
found in the pastures or strongholds of the
enemy. High interest was charged, on account
of the extraordinary precariousness
of what was called the security. Grinding
and grasping undoubtedly the money-lenders
would be, from the hardship of their case.
Reckless extravagance and lavish profusion
were, in those non-commercial ages, highly
applauded. The spendthrift and the prodigal
was the favourite of the multitude; the rich
money-lender was hated and abused, while
his money-bags were sought after with all the
eagerness of hard-driving poverty. They
reviled the careful and economical Israelite;
they looked with horror upon his vast accumulations
of capital, and never remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
to thank him for the safety they owed to him
from the violent hands of their own soldiers
and retainers.</p>

<p>All this went on until the sixteenth or
seventeenth century. I have before me a
very curious old book, lent to me by Mr.
Ruskin, entitled, "The English Usurer: or,
Usury Condemned by the most learned and
famous Divines of the Church of England.
Collected by John Blaxton, Preacher of God's
Word at Osmington, in Dorsetshire, 1634."</p>

<p>The language throughout the book is of
extreme violence against all manner of usury.
The compiler gives a collection of the most
emphatic testimonies of the greatest preachers
of the day against this "detestable vice."
Bishop Jewell calls it "a most filthy trade, a
trade which God detesteth, a trade which is
the very overthrow of all Christian love."
There is, it must be admitted, no sort of
argument attempted in the long extract from
Bishop Jewell's sermon to demonstrate the
wickedness of the practice against which he
launches his fierce invectives, but he certainly
brings his sermon to a conclusion with a
threat of extreme measures "if they continue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
therein. I will open their shame and denounce
excommunication against them, and
publish their names in this place before you
all, that you may know them, and abhor
them as the plagues and monsters of this
world; that if they be past all fear of God,
they may yet repent and amend for worldly
shame."</p>

<p>This was Bishop Jewell preaching in the
middle of the 16th century; and such were
the strong terms very generally employed
by good and thoughtful men at that day.
Bacon (Essay 41) says that one of the objections
against usury is that "it is against
nature for money to beget money!" Antonio,
in "The Merchant of Venice," asks:</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"When did friendship take<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A <i>breed</i> of barren metal of his friend?"<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>And his practice was "neither to lend nor
borrow by taking nor giving of excess," which
brought upon him the malice and vindictiveness
of the Jew&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"that in low simplicity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lends out money gratis, and brings down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rate of usance here with us in Venice."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>Philip, in Tennyson's "Brook "&mdash;a simple man
in later times&mdash;</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Could not understand how money breeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thought it a dead thing."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>But there were men, too, who saw that the
taking of moderate interest was a blameless
act. Calvin was a contemporary of Bishop
Jewell, and his mind exhibits a curious mixture
of feelings upon the subject. Blaxton
triumphantly places a sentence from Calvin's
"Epistola de Usura" as a battle-flag in his
title-page:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In republica bene constituta nemo fænerator
tolerabilis est; sed omnino debet e consortio
hominum rejici." "An usurer is not
tolerable in a well-established Commonwealth,
but utterly to be rejected out of the company
of men." So again, in his Commentary on
Deuteronomy. But again, in a passage quoted
from the same author, without reference, in
Dugald Stewart's Preliminary Dissertation
(Encyd. Brit.) we come across a different
view.</p>

<p>"'Money begets not money!'&mdash;What does
the sea beget? What the house for which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
receive rent? Is silver brought forth from
the walls and the roof? But that is produced
from land, and that is drawn forth from the
sea, which shall produce money; and the convenience
of a house is paid for with a stipulated
sum. Now if better profit can be derived
from the letting out of money than by the
letting of an estate, shall a profit be made by
letting perhaps some barren land to a farmer,
and shall it not be allowed to him who lends
a sum of money? He who gets an estate by
purchase, shall he not from that money derive
an annual profit? Whence then is the merchant's
profit? You will say, from his diligence
and industry. Does anyone suppose
that money ought to lie idle and unprofitable?
He who borrows of me is not going to let the
loan lie idle. He is not going to draw profit
from the money itself, but from the goods
bought with it. Those reasonings, therefore,
against usury are subtle, and have a certain
plausibility; but they fall as soon as they are
examined more narrowly. I therefore conclude
that we are to judge of usury, not from any
particular passage of Scripture, but by the
ordinary rules of justice and equity."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p>To come at once to modern days and practical
views. Let us suppose lending on interest
forbidden by the Church and the law. Then
sums of money required for good and legitimate
business purposes must be begged as a
great favour. No honourable man would do
this. The instinctive repugnance felt by an
independent man to place himself under pecuniary
obligations which he could not reciprocate
would stop many a promising young man
of slender means from going to college, many
a good man of business from using the most
favourable opportunities. I am not speaking
of borrowing money to gain temporary relief
from pecuniary embarrassment, but of money
honourably desired to realize advantages of
apparent life-value. So the necessitous would
be doomed to remain in hopeless necessity
until some benevolently-minded person with
a mass of loose unemployed capital came to
his rescue, and such men are not to be met
with every day.</p>

<p>So far for the man who would like to borrow,
but that the law will not allow it except as a
free loan or gift. Then for the willing lender,
if he dared. He has, say, a few thousands in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
hand, which he does not wish to spend.
He looks round, if he is anxious to use it
for good, for an object of his charity who
seems least likely to disappoint him. Does our
experience of human nature teach that a sense
of gratitude for benefits received is a good
security for honourable conduct? Alas! in a
multitude of cases&mdash;I fear the majority&mdash;the
lender would only be met with cold and alienated
looks when he expected to receive his
own again, if indeed he found anywhere at all
the object of his kindness. The memory of
past ingratitude, the fear of worse to come,
would dry the sources of benevolence, and
make the upright and honest to suffer equally
with the swindler and the hypocrite.</p>

<p>But there is no such fear now. The recognized
system of lending upon approved
security for a fair and moderate rate of
interest removes the irksome, galling sense
of obligation, and enables any man to borrow
with a feeling that if he receives an obligation
he is also conferring one; that if he makes
ten per cent, by trading, or a good stipend
by his degree, he will divide his profits fairly
with the man who served him, and that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
is helping him in his turn to keep his money
together for the sake of his children after
him. Take away these benefits, and what
good is done by free lending? Not any
that we can see with ordinary eyes, but a
good deal of suspicion, disappointment, ingratitude,
and loss.</p>

<p>An honourable man would a hundred times
rather accept a loan as a matter of profit to
the lender than as a charity to himself. The
right result of an honourable system of borrowing
and lending with equal advantage to both,
<i>is</i> the will of God, and not contrary to sanctification.
The result of a compulsory system
of charitable loans would lead only to the
destruction of credit and mutual confidence,
and the sacrifice of a multitude of Christian
graces and virtues.</p>

<p>We cannot help observing with what vehemence
Mr. Ruskin constantly thrusts the
thief, the adulterer, and the usurer all into
the same boat to be tossed against the
breakers of his wrath. Now I would ask
some one of those numerous disciples of his,
whose affection almost prompts them to say
to him, "I will follow thee whithersoever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
thou goest," "Pray, my good friend, what
is your own practice? Providence has
blessed you with ease and affluence far
more than you need for daily bread. What
do you do with your money? Of course
you would never think of investing in consols,
in railway shares, or dock-bonds, would
you? you would not lend money upon mortgage,
or exact rent for your household and
landed property? I see that you hesitate
a little; you have something to confess.
Come! what is it?" And my amiable friend
replies, "Oh, but you see all the world
is gone after interest of money; all our
mutual relations are so intimately bound up
with that accursed, abominable practice, that
I have no alternative. <i>I have</i> large sums
lodged in various safe investments, and
employ an agent to collect my rents and
settle with my tenants." And so I am forced
to exclaim, "What! you who are persuaded
that usury, and theft, and adultery, are all
of equal blackness, if you find that one
sin is unavoidable, what about the other
two? Would you then invite the robber and
the licentious to sin with impunity, as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
practise your own convenient iniquity, with
the applause of the world and your own
acquiescence?"</p>

<p>Positively I see no escape from this argument.
It is the <i>argumentum ad hominem</i>,&mdash;generally
an uncivil mode of address; but
here, at any rate, it is impersonally used.</p>

<p>These are my views frankly stated. If
I am wrong, even by the highest standard
of Christian ethics, I shall be thankful for
Mr. Ruskin's corrections.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidelink"><a href="#X">Letter X</a></span>
</p>

<h4>On Letter X</h4>

<p>The letters which I have received up to
the present time (October 31st) in reply to
Mr. Ruskin's have not failed to bring me not a
little of disappointment. On the one hand, I
see a man noble and elevated in his aims, and
with highest aspirations, desiring nothing so
fervently as to see the world and its pastors
and teachers rising to the highest attainable
level of religious and moral excellence; fearlessly
rebuking the evils he sees so clearly;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
clothing thoughts that consume him in words
that stir our inmost hearts; and yet I see him
unavoidably missing his aim as all men are
liable to do, through the defect of possessing
human language alone as the channel to convey
divine meanings; and, moreover, who cannot
at every turn stay the course of their reasoning
to explain that that which they speak apparently,
and from the necessities of language,
to <i>all</i>, is, as the most ordinary apprehension
would perceive, really addressed to <i>some</i>.</p>

<p>On the other side, while I hear many expressing
their thankfulness that things are
now being said that "wanted saying," and
are being spoken out with uncompromising
boldness, others receive them with impatience,
with irritation, with exasperation. I have been
gravely advised to recommend Mr. Ruskin to
withdraw these letters, to wash my hands of
them, etc. Sometimes this arises from unfamiliarity
with Mr. Ruskin's most famous
works; sometimes from entire unacquaintance
with their number and their nature; as when
a friend wrote to me before he saw or heard
a word of the letters:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If Mr. Ruskin thinks we have generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
read his <i>publication</i> (<i>sic</i>) I think he is mistaken;
all I know of <i>it</i> is that I have occasionally
seen <i>it</i> quoted in newspapers, from which
I gather that he holds peculiar opinions."</p>

<p>A lady, who looked well to the ways of her
household, but knew very little of books, once
asked me if Mr. Ruskin had not written a
book called the "Old Red Sandstone." I
hinted that probably she meant the "Stones
of Venice," which was indeed the case. She
knew it was something about stones! But
she was an excellent creature nevertheless!</p>

<p>These two traits may fairly be paired
together.</p>

<p>It should be observed, by clergymen especially
who read these letters attentively, that
they contain just what we clergy ought to
be told sometimes by laymen, to whom we
preach with perfect impunity, but who as a rule
rarely make reply. I have just read Lord
Carnarvon's excellent address on Preaching,
delivered at the Winchester Diocesan Conference,
and thank him as I thank, and for the
same reason that I thank, Mr. Ruskin. We
need to be told wholesome though unpalatable
truths sometimes, when we have descended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
from our castle-pulpits to meet, it may be, the
eyes, and hear the voices, of impatient, irritated,
and prejudiced critics.</p>

<p>I do not remember that so bold an attack,
and yet so friendly, has ever before been made
upon our weak points in modern times; and
I may justly claim for Mr. Ruskin's letters a
calm, self-searching, and, if need be, a self-condemning
and self-sacrificing, examination.
We are all too apt to cry "Peace, peace, where
there is no peace." Why should the shepherds
of Britain claim for themselves a more indulgent
regard than the shepherds of Israel,
whom Ezekiel, by the word of the Lord,
addressed in the 33rd and 34th chapters of
his prophecy?</p>

<p>Concerning the letter before us on the forgiveness
of sins&mdash;each other's sins or debts,
and our sins before God&mdash;it is not a question
of theology, but of simple moral right and
wrong; and I defy Mr. Ruskin's bitterest
censors to deny, that, in this wicked world,
men are more in earnest in deceiving, injuring,
and swindling their friends than they
are in seeking the love of their enemies.
Has not our Lord told us long ago that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
"the children of this world are wiser" (that
is, more earnest, consistent, and thorough-going)
"in their generation than the children
of light"?</p>

<p>It is of extreme difficulty to <i>understand</i> the
clause, says Mr. Ruskin. Replies some slow-witted
preacher: "Where is the difficulty?
I both understand it and explain it with perfect
ease!" What! understand the precious
conditions on which forgiveness will be extended
to us! The question of God's forgiveness
is not a <i>simple</i> question. It is complicated
by its relation to men's mutual forgiveness
of each other, and that again by the practical
difficulty of knowing when we can, and when,
from the very nature of the case, we cannot,
forgive. Here are surely elements of difficulty
quite sufficient to justify the remark that "the
clause is one of such difficulty that, to understand
it, means almost to know the love of
God which passeth knowledge."</p>

<p>But we may, at any rate, guard our people
against <i>misunderstanding</i> it; and they are
guilty, and full of guilt, who live in sin,&mdash;sins
of avarice, of ill temper, of calumny, of
hatred, of sensuality, and of unforgivingness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
and yet daily ask to be forgiven, because,
forsooth, they are innocent of any bad
intention!</p>

<p>No man or woman who sins with the knowledge
that it <i>is</i> sin can have God's forgiveness.
It is no use to plead the frailty of the flesh.
It is wilful, knowing, deliberate sin; and it
will not be forgiven without a very living,
earnest, and working faith indeed.</p>

<p>I question much whether we preachers of
the Gospel say enough upon this point,&mdash;not
at all that we underrate its importance,
nor that we overrate the importance of that
which we are apt to call Gospel preaching
<span class="grk" title="kat' exochên">κατ' ἐξοχήν</span>, namely, the doctrine of the atonement
by the Blood of Christ, which is the
brightness and glory of the Gospel message,
but is no more all of it than that the sum of
the Lord's Prayer is contained in one of its
clauses.</p>

<p>"As we forgive them that trespass against
us." Shall I be pardoned for venturing here
upon a remark which seems needful to make
in the presence of so much that appears to be
erroneous on the subject of human forgiveness?
And it is more especially necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
be understood in the case of the clergy, because
such large demands are made upon
their forgiveness as it is impossible to satisfy.
I do not at all say that there are trespasses
which men cannot forgive,&mdash;sins, I mean, of
the ordinary type, and not crimes. But I do
say that there are times and circumstances
under which forgiveness is a moral impossibility.
And yet the world expects a clergyman
to be ever walking up and down in
society with forgiveness on his lips and forgiveness
in both his hands. Our Lord said,
"If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke
him; and <i>if he repent</i>, forgive him" (Luke
xvii. 3); and forgiveness is to follow each
successive profession of repentance. And in
Matt. xviii. 22, though repentance is not
named, it is manifestly implied. In 2 Cor.
ii. 7, again, sorrow for the sin is a condition
of forgiveness. This, then, is the rule and
condition of forgiveness, that our brother
<i>repent</i>; and manifestly it must be so; for the
act of forgiveness requires a correlative disposition
to seek and receive forgiveness, just
as a gift implies not only a giver but a
receiver, or it cannot be a gift, do what we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
will. I think this is extremely apt to be
overlooked even by the larger, that is, the
more emotional and impulsive part of the
world, though not, of course, by the more
thoughtful; and clergymen especially are asked
to speak fair, and sue for peace, and all but
ask for forgiveness of those who are habitually
and obstinately bent upon doing them
all the wrong and injury in their power,
and using them with the most intolerable
harshness.</p>

<p>What, then, does true religion require of
us if such circumstances make forgiveness
impossible? To be ever ready, ever prepared
to forgive; to seek every opening, every
avenue to peace without sacrifice of self-respect
and manly independence; to watch
for opportunities to do kindnesses to the
most inveterate enemy,&mdash;even where a change
of heart appears hopeless. This is possible
to a Christian, and this is what Christ
demands. But He does not demand impossibilities.
He does not ask us to do more
than our Heavenly Father Himself, who forgives
the returning sinner even "a great
way off," if his face be but homeward; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
says nothing of forgiveness to him whose back
is towards his home, and whose heart dwells
far away.</p>

<p>I am sure Mr. Ruskin does not mean that
no clergyman is sensible of the guilt of sins
of omission. But he is speaking as a layman,
who has heard in his time a great many
preachers, and it is very probable indeed that
he has not heard many dwell long and forcibly
on the fact, which is indeed a fact, that
the guilt of sins of omission is the burden of
Christ's teaching, and that more parables and
more preaching are directed against the sin
of doing nothing at all than against the positive
and active wickedness of bad men. If
we will be candid, we must agree with him
that in our general teaching we do lay much
less emphasis on such sins than our Lord
does in <i>His</i> teaching.</p>

<p>But in the paragraph which follows, I confess
that, following up a charge which is sadly
too true, that there is a grotesque inconsistency
"in the willingness of human nature
to be taxed with any quantity of sins in the
gross, and its resentment at the insinuation
of having committed the smallest parcel of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
them in detail," there comes a sentence in
which the Christian philosopher loses himself
in the caustic satirist, and that this vein
continues to the end of the letter. In satire,
such is its very essence, truth is ever travestied.
It is truth still, but the truth in
unfamiliar, and, for the most part, unacceptable
guise. There is just an undercurrent of
truth, and no more, in the statement, not very
seriously made, one would suppose, that the
English Liturgy was "drawn up with the
amiable intention of making religion as pleasant
as possible, to a people desirous of saving
their souls with no great degree of personal
inconvenience."</p>

<p>If the whole naked truth were spoken with
the deepest gravity that the awful pressure of
our sins demands, the English Liturgy would
be a continuous wail of grief and repentance.
For if anything is great, and loud, and urgent,
it is the cry of our sins. But co-extensive
with our sins is the love of our Father; and,
therefore, our mourning is changed into rejoicing
and thankfulness, and this picture of
the sinner "dexterously concealing the manner
of his sin from man, and triumphantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
confessing the quantity of it to God," is merely
a satire.</p>

<p>The next paragraph is more bitter still; but
happily for the cause of sober truth, it is
satire again; and nothing can be more obvious
than the fact that prayer, to be Common
Prayer, cannot at the same time suit every
condition of mind, the calm and the agitated,
the strained and the relaxed, the rejoicing and
the sorrowful. But we are not dependent
upon public worship for the satisfaction of
our spiritual wants, as long as we can resort
to private prayer and family prayer. And,
indeed, it requires no wonderful stretch of
our powers of adaptation to use the most
strenuous private prayer in the midst of the
congregation; and the "remorseful publican"
and the "timid sinner" are not bound to the
words before them, or if they do follow these
words, I am sure there is enough depth in
them to satisfy the views of the most conscience-stricken.
Common Prayer is calm to
the calm, and passionate to the passionate.
It is all things to all men, just according to
their frame of mind at the time.</p>

<p>But alas for my good kind friend! as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
get nearer to the end of the letter, the satire
waxes fiercer, and the adherence to the truth
of nature grows fainter. Does Mr. Ruskin
seriously, or only sarcastically, tell us that the
assaults upon the divine power of prayer gain
any force from the circumstance that we are
constrained to pray daily for forgiveness, never
getting so far as to need it no longer? From
the first day that we lisped at our mother's
knee, "Forgive us our trespasses," until, bowed
with age, we <i>still</i> say, "Forgive us our trespasses,"
we have never stood, and never will
stand, one day less in need of forgiveness
than another day&mdash;or our Lord would have
provided a thanksgiving and a prayer for the
perfected.</p>

<p>I believe everywhere else I recognize, even
in the most startling passages, an element of
truth. But in the latter half of this letter,
not even the large amount of acrimony and
severity allowed to the mode of address called
satire can quite reconcile us to its marvellous
asperity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span></p>

<p>
<span class="sidelink"><a href="#XI">Letter XI</a></span>
</p>

<h4>On Letter XI</h4>

<p>I cannot but feel astonished and grieved at
the perversity of those who<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> persist in looking
upon Mr. Ruskin as altogether a noxious
kind of a scribbler, and likely to do much
injury by the unflagging constancy with which
he perseveres in pointing his finger at all our
weak and sore places. And yet it cannot
be said that even if he does "lade men with
burdens grievous to be borne," he himself
"touches not the burdens with one of his
fingers."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>But let us consider this last letter. Is not
every word of it true&mdash;severely and austerely
true,&mdash;but still true? But yet here still the
fault remains (though I say it with the utmost
deference, remembering that, after all, I have
infinitely more to learn than I have to teach),
the fault remains that the truth is put too
keenly, too incisively, to be classed with practical
truths.</p>

<p>Yes, the petitions of the Lord's Prayer are
for a perfect state in this life. We do pray
for a Paradise upon earth, where either temptation
shall no longer exist, or where sin shall
have lost its power to injure by losing its
power to allure. But will the most incessant
prayer, individual, combined, or congregational,
ever bring us to perfection? Alas! my friend,
you would gladly persuade us so; you would
lead the way yourself, but that the first half-dozen
steps you take would have, or have
long ago, proved to you that sin is ever present,
even in the best and purest of men.</p>

<p>I trust they are very few indeed who are
so easily persuaded by the conceited self-sufficiency
of the "scientific people" to cease from
prayer under the belief that all things move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
on under the control of inflexible laws, which
neither prayer nor the will of God, if God has
a will, can change or modify. Magee<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> has a
valuable note on the subject of the "Consistency
of Prayer with the Divine Immutability,"
in which he puts this truth in a
mathematical form. He says, "The relation
of God to man + prayer is different from the
relation of God to man &ndash; prayer. Yet God
remains constant. It is man who is the better
or the worse for prayer or no prayer."</p>


<p>It is pleasant to reflect that with the simple-minded
Christian the belief in Christ, because
he knows that Christ loved him and died for
him, is exceedingly little moved by these so-called
scientific doubts. The propounders of
these entangling questions move in a region
where he would feel cold and his life would be
crushed out of him, and he declines to follow
science at so great a cost, believing besides
that science might often be better termed
nescience, for he has no faith in such science.
Instead of being presented with clear deductions,
drawn from observation and experience,
he sees but too plainly that, as each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
philosopher frames his own belief out of his
inner consciousness, there cannot fail to come
out a very large variety of beliefs, and that, if
the religion of the Bible were exploded and
became an obsolete thing, its place would
be usurped by a motley crowd of infinitely
varied creeds of every shape and hue, each
claiming for itself, with more or less modesty
and reserve, but with just equal rights, the
supremacy over men's consciences. And in
the meanwhile, women and children and the
poor, and in fact all who are not altogether
highly, transcendentally intellectual, must, for
want of the requisite faculties and opportunities,
do without any religion at all. I
suppose most people can see this, and therefore
will pay a very limited attention to the
claims and pretensions of science-worship.</p>

<p>I come to a sentence where once more the
proclivity for satire breaks out for a minute:
"But in modern days the first aim of all
Christians is to place their children in circumstances
where the temptations (which they are
apt to call opportunities) may be as great and
as many as possible; where the sight and
promise of 'all these things' in Satan's gift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
may be brilliantly near." I was reading this
from the MS. to a mother, accomplished and
amiable, who of course thought in a moment
of her own little flock of sons and daughters,
all the objects of the tenderest care and solicitude;
and she felt that she at least had not
deserved this stroke. But the truth is that
we must read this sentence as we read our
Lord's, "Think not that I am come to send
peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but
a sword" (Matt. x. 34). The sword was not
the object of our Lord's coming, but the unhappy
result through sin. He came to bring
peace on earth, yet was He "set for the fall
of many in Israel." The wisest and best of
parents place their sons in the profession or
position in life where temptations abound, not
because they desire to see them bow before
Satan, and become the possessors of "all
these things" which he promises "I will give
thee," but because there is no position in the
active life of the world that is free from
temptations; and those temptations are the
strongest and most numerous often just where
the real and undoubted advantages are the
greatest and most numerous. Mr. Ruskin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
with a strong and legitimate figure of speech,
is simply putting an inevitable result as the
work of apparent design.</p>

<p>If the distinction between the glory and the
power of the kingdom of God and the false
lustre of earthly power and worldly allurements
is not sufficiently dwelt upon in our
pulpits, none will regret it more than the
earnest preachers in whom the modern Church
of England abounds. If it be granted, as I
think it must be granted, that the highest
wisdom is not always exercised in the choice
and preparation of our subjects of preaching,
every true-hearted and loyal Churchman must
be grateful for the fearless candour of the
writer of the letters we have been considering,
in pointing out to us our prevailing deficiencies,
even if he does not, which is not his province,
point out how to attain perfection.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTERS_FROM_CLERGY" id="LETTERS_FROM_CLERGY"></a>LETTERS FROM CLERGY
AND LAITY</h2>

<h5>(FROM THE FIRST EDITION)</h5>


<p>The following letters have been entrusted
to me for publication in this
work. The writers of twenty-two of
them are clergymen, of whom sixteen
are members of three Clerical Societies,
all of whom have read their letters before
the Societies to which they belong, except
in the case of one Society, where it
was impracticable. The remaining six
have been kind enough to write in acceptance
of the invitation in the <i>Contemporary
Review</i> for December, 1879.
The remaining letters are from members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
of the laity, attracted by the same proposal.
Many others have been received;
but it would not have been possible to
include them all in a volume of moderate
size, some of them besides being of
great length; and I was therefore, with
regret, obliged to decline them.</p>

<p>It was not originally intended that
the invitation to discuss these questions
should be extended to laymen. But
several so understood it from the preface
in the <i>Contemporary</i>, and when I
came to examine the letters sent on this
understanding, I felt a conviction that
a true and safe light would be thrown
upon the subject by their assistance; and,
using the discretionary power allowed
me by Mr. Ruskin, I thought it, on the
whole, best to give admission to a
certain number of communications from
laymen.</p>

<p>Besides, as they themselves are, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
great measure, the subjects of the discussion,
and, therefore, must feel a
lively interest in it, it seems but fair
that they too should have a voice in
the matter. Another reason yet had
considerable weight with me, that their
letters evince a larger and more liberal
sympathy with Mr. Ruskin himself
than those of some of my clerical
brethren, in whose letters there is but
too perceptible a degree of irascibility,
not unnatural to us, perhaps, in finding
ourselves rather sharply lectured by a
layman&mdash;the shepherds by the sheep.
And I hoped that a more fraternal
spirit would be promoted by my free
acceptance of their ready offer.</p>

<p>The same consenting spirit is all but
universal in the notices of the press
upon Mr. Ruskin's letters. But I do
not wish to anticipate the judgment
of "the Church and the world" upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
the whole series of letters here presented.
Notwithstanding the peculiar
and sometimes rather bewildering effect
of a variety of "cross lights," they
appear to myself to be invested with
singular interest as a faithful reflection
of the opinions of the clergy and the
laity upon some of the most stirring
religious questions of the day.</p>

<p>Moreover, it will, I am sure, please
readers who have endeavoured in vain
to extract some meaning out of many
of the sometimes tedious and unintelligible
essayists of the day, to observe
that the discussion in this volume at
least is carried on in language perfectly
clear and within the reach of ordinary
understandings. At any rate, I hope
it will not be said of any of the writers
who have together made up this little
volume: "Who is this that darkeneth
counsel by words without knowledge?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span></p>

<p>Before the sheets are sent to press
they will be perused by Mr. Ruskin,
who will then use his privilege of replying,
thus bringing the volume to a
conclusion.</p>

<p>I could not undertake to classify these
letters; and have, therefore, as the
simplest mode, arranged them in the
alphabetical order of the writers' names.</p>

Fenny Compton</i>.</h4>


<p>Mr. Ruskin compares the clergyman with
an Alpine guide, whose business it is simply
to carry the traveller in safety over rocks and
glaciers to the mountain top. He is not to
trouble himself or his charge with needless
refinements of doctrine. He is not to exaggerate
the dignity of his office, or to give
himself out as anything but a guide. In
particular, he is not to assume anything of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
mediatorial character. He is to preach the
Gospel&mdash;not of Luther nor of Augustine, but
of Christ; in plain words and short terms.
He is to proclaim aloud, boldly and constantly,
"This is the will of the Lord,"&mdash;to apply, that
is, the morality of the Gospel, stringently and
authoritatively, to the lives of his people. To
effect this application with more power, he
is to exercise a rigid discipline, and exclude
from his congregation all who are not acting
up to what he conceives to be the Gospel
ideal. He is not to hamper himself with any
set and formal Liturgy, which can never be
copious or flexible enough to meet the varied
needs of a number of men differing widely in
knowledge and attainment.</p>

<p>Every one will feel what a crowd of perplexities
start up here at every sentence. In
what sense is a clergyman like a Chamouni
guide? There is a resemblance, no doubt,
but not of a kind on which it would be possible
to build any argument. It is not the
business of the Alpine guide to exercise any
supervision over the morals of his employers,
or to ask how they earned the money with
which he is paid. Again, what is meant by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
the Gospel of Christ not according to anybody?
It is easy to reject the authority of
St. Paul or St. John, or of Luther or Augustine,
but there is one commentator whose
influence cannot be shaken off, and that is
ourselves. And our experience of those who
have professed to preach the Gospel pure
and simple is not reassuring. Does Mr.
Ruskin mean that we are to burn all our
theology,&mdash;even apparently the Epistles of St.
Paul,&mdash;and to forget all Church history since
the day of the Crucifixion? Does he mean
that we are each to set up a theology&mdash;a
Church of his own? It would be but a poor
gain to most of us to exchange the great
lamps of famous doctors for the uncertain
rushlights of our own imaginations.</p>

<p>Then again, what is this new and more
than Genevan discipline that the clergyman
is to enforce? He is to take more pains to
get wicked rich men to stay out of the church
than to persuade wicked poor ones to enter
it. After putting his own interpretation upon
the Gospel, he is to lay under an interdict
all whom his own fire-new formula&mdash;for a
formula he must still have&mdash;excludes. He is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
to force, by the method of Procrustes, the
visible Church into co-extension with the invisible.
No community of Christians has ever
attempted such a task. Any zealous (surely
over-zealous) parish priest who should so
narrow the limits of his fold, who should exclude
the "usurer" from the ordinary means
of grace, for fear lest he should take God's
name in vain by joining in the public prayers,
would expose himself, may we not think?
to the reproach of being less merciful than
He who sends rain on the just and the unjust.
Nor, as he looked round upon his carefully-selected
congregation, could he easily flatter
himself that he was preaching the Gospel "to
every creature."</p>

<p>Again, what is the will of the Lord, and
what does Mr. Ruskin mean by proclaiming
it? That He loves righteousness and hates
iniquity we know. The difficulty is in applying
this general rule in detail. What is its
bearing upon the policy of the Government,
upon any particular trade strike, upon the
tangled web of good and evil motives which
makes up the moral consciousness of an
average shopkeeper? I conceive Mr. Ruskin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
to be thinking of preachers like Bernard,
Savonarola, or Latimer, of denunciations like
those of Isaiah, or of our Lord. He seems
to mean that the clergyman should stand on
a clear mountain summit, looking down over
the whole field of life, discerning with the
eye of a prophet every movement of evil on
a small scale or on a large. There have
been such teachers in whose hands science,
economy, politics, seemed all to become
branches of theology, members of one great
body of Divine truth. But not every man's
lips are thus touched with the coal from the
altar. Many an excellent and most useful
preacher would make but wild work if he took
to denouncing social movements or the spirit
of the age. A singular illustration of the
danger that besets these sweeping moral judgments
is to be found in Mr. Ruskin's own
denunciation of usury, that is, of taking interest
for money. Few people will agree
either with the particular opinion that every
old lady who lives harmlessly on her railway
dividends ought to be excommunicated, or
with the general principle implied in this
opinion, that every prohibition in the Old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
Testament is still as valid as ever under social
circumstances altogether different.</p>

<p>People who need denouncing do not, as a
rule, come to church to be denounced. And
it would be a great error to conclude, from
our Lord's language to the Pharisees and
Sadducees, that the tone in which He addressed
the individual sinner was harsh or
scathing. The preacher must remember that
he is a physician of souls, and the physician's
touch is gentle. Think for a moment what
worldliness is&mdash;how easy it is to say bitter
things about it!&mdash;and then picture to yourselves
a little tradesman with a wife and seven
or eight children to keep on his scanty profits.
What wonder if he sets too high a value on
money? How difficult for him to understand
the words which bid him take no thought for
the morrow!</p>

<p>There is a time, no doubt, for fierce language,
but it does not often come. The
preacher is no more exempt than other people
from the golden rule to put himself in his
neighbour's place, and try to see things with
his neighbour's eyes.</p>

<p>Another difficulty arises out of the manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
in which Mr. Ruskin speaks of the relation
of his Chamouni guides to dogmatic teaching.
They ought not, he says, to be compelled to
hold opinions on the subject, say, of the height
of the Celestial Mountains, the crevasses which
go down quickest to the pit, and other cognate
points of science, differing from, or even contrary
to, the tenets of the guides of the Church
of France.</p>

<p>It is difficult in the extreme to know exactly
what is here meant. No doubt it is needless
for a guide to drop a plumb-line down every
crevasse that he has to cross. It would be
great waste of time to lecture his travellers on
the laws that regulate the motion of glaciers
or the dip of the mountain strata. But what
are the doctrines that stand in this relation,
or this no-relation, to the spiritual life? Is it
meant that all theology should be swept away
like a dusty old cobweb?</p>

<p>I would go myself as far as this, that the
fewer and simpler the doctrines that a clergyman
preaches, the better; that all doctrines
should be required to pass the test of reason
and conscience, which are also in their degrees
Divine revelations, so far, at least, as this, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
no doctrine can be admitted which is demonstrably
repugnant to either one or the other.
And in the third place, the greatest care should
be taken to discriminate matters of faith, real
axioms of religion, from pious opinions or
venerable practices which have no vital connection
with the Christian faith; which, to
use Burke's phrase, all understandings do not
ratify, and all hearts do not approve. A grave
responsibility rests upon those who neglect
this discrimination. It is also a point of the
highest importance that when most doctrinal
a clergyman should be least dogmatic; that
he should remember that all doctrine, by the
necessity of the case, is cast into an antithetical,
more or less paradoxical shape; that he
should never lose sight of the harmony and
balance between intersecting truths, or of that
unfortunate tendency of the human mind to
seize upon and appropriate points of difference
in their crudest and most antagonistic form, to
the exclusion of points of agreement; that he
should always do his best to show the reasonableness
of the Christian teaching, its analogy
and harmony with all the works of God; that
where his knowledge fails, he should frankly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
confess that it does fail, and not try to eke it
out by guesses, or to disguise its insufficiency
by rhetoric.</p>

<p>But after all these allowances it remains a
fact that the clergyman is not a guide only,
but a teacher, an ambassador. He is to teach
his people all that he knows about God and
His relation to the soul of man. He is to
study and meditate himself, and to set forth
the conclusion he has reached fully and fearlessly.
And if he discharges this duty reasonably
and zealously, he need not be afraid
of finding that there is a gulf fixed between
doctrine and practice. These two must go
together. There can be no conduct deserving
the name without a philosophy of conduct,
and that philosophy is a sound divinity. Even
the loftiest and most abstruse doctrines must
have an influence upon life. It is a common
remark that scientific truth should be pursued
for its own sake, and that the most valuable
practical results have often followed from investigations
carried out with a single eye to
the truth. It is an equally common remark
that those teach the simplest things best
whose range of knowledge and belief is widest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
We might point to Mr. Ruskin himself as a
striking illustration of this. What is simpler
than beauty? what more universally apprehended?
what at first sight more incapable of
analysis? Yet as we listen to the great critic,
what wonderful laws does he point out&mdash;what
a wealth of knowledge does he bring to bear&mdash;how
clear he makes it to us that the power
of feeling (still more the power of creating)
beauty is the hard-won fruit of labour, study,
and devotion. So it is with life: those who
would create a beautiful life must know the
laws of spiritual beauty,&mdash;and those laws are
theology.</p>

<p>But criticism is a thankless task. It is a
more gracious and, towards a great man, a
more respectful office to note those points on
which our debt to Mr. Ruskin is acknowledged,
and our sympathy with him unalloyed. These
letters are, in spirit at any rate, not unworthy
of the man who has exercised a deeper and
wider influence upon the morality of our time
than any other, except perhaps Thomas Carlyle.
And the great lesson of each of these
eloquent teachers is the duty of Reality. There
are many points in which we do not agree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
with them: let us be all the readier to acknowledge
the debt that we owe. Both laymen,&mdash;like
Amos, neither prophets nor sons of
prophets,&mdash;they have done a work which,
perhaps, under the altered circumstances of
society, no professional preacher could have
achieved. Any one who considers the earnestness
and reverence of modern intellectual
literature; the anxious desire even of the
Agnostic to lay the foundations of his moral
life as deep as possible; the manifold efforts,
while denying all religion, yet to maintain the
union of imagination and reason, without which
there can be no loftiness of character, no
nobility of aspiration, yet which nothing but
religion can consecrate and fructify,&mdash;and
compares all this with the sneering, self-satisfied
flippancy of Gibbon and Voltaire,
will feel how vast is the change for the better;
and these two writers have been the chief
instruments in bringing that change about.</p>

<p>Let me notice briefly two points on which
Mr. Ruskin insists in these letters with great
force and beauty. The first is the love of
the Father. No text is more familiar than
that which tells us that "God is love." It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
not indeed inconsistent with that other text
which tells us that He is "a consuming fire."
But if its meaning is fully imbibed and allowed
to bear its natural fruit, it must result in the
abandonment of those forensic views of our
blessed Lord's atonement, which all the
subtlety of Canon Mozley cannot bring into
harmony with the dictates of our consciences.
If the Father is love, there can be no division,
no antithesis between the Father and the Son.
If He is love, then the idea of sacrifice, which
is of the essence of love, must enter into our
conception of the Father also. I say no more
about this, because any one who chooses to
do so may find the Fatherhood of God, and
all that it implies, treated of with great fulness
and a marvellous depth of spiritual insight in
the letters of Erskine of Linlathen.</p>

<p>It can hardly be doubted that the kind of
language which Protestants of a certain class
have been, and still are, in the habit of using,
about the "Scheme of Redemption," constitutes
a most serious stumbling-block in the way
of many an earnest spirit. There are few
preachers probably, and few congregations
now,&mdash;in the Establishment at any rate,&mdash;who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
would not revolt against the hideous calmness
with which Jonathan Edwards contemplates
the "little spiders" dropping off into the
flames. But a great deal of mischief remains
to be undone. Those who are acquainted with
the biographies of Shelley, of James and of
John Stuart Mill, know well what effect the
fierce doctrines of Calvinism have produced
upon minds which for the issues of morality
and, surely, even of religion, were "finely
touched." And who can tell what horror and
indignation have been wrought in some minds,
what agonies of despair in others, who, when
at last the blessed work of repentance began
to stir within them, and they turned their eyes
for comfort to the cross, were met by the terrible
warning that none but the select few can
call God their Father, and that in all probability
their own eternal tortures were decreed
before ever they entered the world?</p>

<p>The other point to which I must briefly
advert is Mr. Ruskin's protest against the use
of words which imply&mdash;which leave the least
possibility of hoping for&mdash;a mechanical absolution,
a pardon of sins that have not been
abandoned. I do not indeed think that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
reproach of using such language falls upon
those who are fond of the title of priests alone,
for the doctrines of Calvinism are far more
liable to abuse. Nor do I think that any
preaching of our clergy on this subject can
be said to have "turned our cities into loathsome
centres of fornication and covetousness."
But here, if anywhere, we ought never to
forget the danger of even seeming to set
Theology against Reason and Conscience, of
allowing the least pretext for thinking that a
mere intellectual assent to abstract truths on
the one hand, a mere acceptance of ecclesiastical
ordinances on the other, can wipe away
sins; or that a heart unpurified by charity
and obedience, could be at rest even in the
kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>Thank God, all good men are broader and
better than their creed,&mdash;better and broader,
I mean, than those parts of their creed
which they insist upon most, because they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
distinguish them from other people. (These
distinguishing points are always of the least
importance, in my opinion.) And with my
experience of sermons for nearly forty years
(for I was very early "called upon to hear
sermons"), I am not conscious of such universal
omissions on the part of the "priests"
of the Church of England as Mr. Ruskin
affirms. The universality of the <i>love</i> of God
the <i>Father</i>, embracing even the "<i>wicked rich</i>"
as well as the "wicked poor," is largely dwelt
upon by all "schools."</p>

<p>The kingdom of God <i>in this present sinful
world</i> is preached and is laboured for. In the
present, however, it is more correctly described
as the <i>kingdom of Christ</i>. When "the end
comes," "He shall deliver up the kingdom
to God, <i>even the Father</i>" (1 Cor. xv. 24, and
<i>seqq.</i>) As for denouncing the sins of the
rich, this is largely done, and especially by
"lively young ecclesiastics" in great towns.
And as to preaching forgiveness without
amendment, no man of common sense can do
that; but Mr. Ruskin may say that common
sense is rare among the clergy; and some
may be afraid to preach morality, because of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
an old-fashioned superstition that <i>morality</i> is
opposed to the <i>Gospel</i>. However, I do not
hear much of such preaching. As for the
duty of every man to do something of the
work of the world for his daily bread, that is
largely taught; and I believe that the kingdom
of God is coming in that respect. A great
deal of the drudgery of the world is done by
big men now. Also I think that the sinfulness
of <i>omission</i> is much insisted on by the
clergy, as it is abundantly noticed in the
Prayer Book, in accordance with the clear
teaching of Christ. And the same may be
said upon the <i>personal guilt</i> of sin. A good
clergyman never allows his people to shelter
themselves <i>in a crowd</i>.</p>

<p>I do not feel the force of the taunt about
our saying every week, "There is no health
in us," because the most "healthy" Christian
finds out always fresh failings as his conscience
grows more healthy (not morbidly
sensitive), and he is always ready to join in
the general confession to his dying day.</p>

<p>There is some value in the remark about
Christian parents putting their children into
situations where they will be tempted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
worship the devil in order to win the kingdom
of the world; but here, as elsewhere, the exaggeration,
for the sake of being forcible, is
too marked.</p>

<i>From the Rev.</i> <span class="smcap">Henry M. Fletcher</span>.</h4>


<p>"Yes," I should say, "it is possible to put
the Gospel of Christ into such plain words
and short terms as that a plain man may
understand it, and plain men do understand
it. And it is not left to be gathered out of
(any of) the Thirty-nine Articles, which are
meant not for simple but for clerkly people."</p>

<p>You seem to have felt it startling that Mr.
Ruskin should ask for a simple and comprehensible
statement of the Christian Gospel&mdash;at
least Mr. Ruskin represents the case so.
What Christ's ministers are bidden to go into
all the world and preach is&mdash;the good news
that God has reconciled the world unto Himself
in Jesus Christ His Son; and that whosoever
will accept this Jesus as His Lord and
Saviour shall have eternal life through Him.
You could not, I think, arrive at a definition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
of what the Gospel of Christ is by explaining
the terms of the Lord's Prayer.</p>

<p>You must tell first about <i>Jesus</i>, our Lord,
and what He has done, before child or man
can have any proper notion of "the Gospel."
The Gospel is a message from "Our Father
which is in Heaven," of His love, and of what
His love&mdash;the love of Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost&mdash;has devised and executed for the redemption
and glorification (through sanctification)
of His rebellious children.</p>

<p>There can be small objection taken to Mr.
Ruskin's proposal to make the Lord's Prayer
"a foundation of Gospel teaching, as containing
what all Christians are agreed upon as
first to be taught," if the "Gospel teaching"
is understood to be "teaching the truth to
<i>Christians</i>." But "the Gospel teaching or
preaching," which is spoken of by Mr. Ruskin,
is "Gospel preaching" to the world not yet
Christian, either Jewish or heathen; and the
Lord's Prayer cannot properly be taken as a
foundation of Gospel teaching to it. It must
be told first of Jesus and His work, and must
have owned Him "Lord," before it can rightly
be taught from <i>His</i> prayer. This prayer can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
have no <i>authority</i> but to those who have
become His disciples. Those who are already
His disciples learn naturally from Him their
relation and their duty to His Father and
their Father. St. Paul, in preaching to the
Athenians, dwells not on the Fatherhood <i>of
God</i>, but on the need of repentance as a preparation
for the judgment which awaits all.
"Jesus and the Resurrection" was what they
heard of first from this model preacher.</p>

<p>Profitable as it is to listen to Mr. Ruskin,

additional plea on behalf of those truths for
which Mr. Maurice so bravely and so passionately

Mr. Ruskin what they never would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>

It is, of course, for the truth, and not for his

I am sure, be a matter of small moment to
him so long as the truth be sought for,

<p>It is in the spirit which is expressed in
these words that I desire to offer the following
notes on Mr. Ruskin's Letters. Among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
charges which he brings against the clergy
are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>That we have no clear idea of our calling,
or of the Gospel of Christ (Letters <a href="#III">III.</a>
and <a href="#IV">IV.</a>)</p>

<p>That we profane the name of God in the
pulpit (<a href="#VI">Letter VI.</a>)</p>

<p>That we teach that every one that doeth
evil is good in the sight of the Lord, and He
delighteth in them (<a href="#VIII">Letter VIII.</a>)</p>

<p>That we hold our office to be that, not of
showing men how to do their Father's will on
earth, but how to get to heaven without doing
any of it either here or there (<a href="#VIII">Letter VIII.</a>)</p>

<p>That we neither profess to understand what
the will of the Lord is, nor to teach anybody
else to do it (<a href="#VIII">Letter VIII.</a>)</p>

<p>That we pretend to absolve the sinner from
his punishment, instead of purging him from
his sin (<a href="#VIII">Letter VIII.</a>)</p>

<p>That we patronize and encourage all the
iniquity of the world by steadily preaching
away the penalties of it (<a href="#VIII">Letter VIII.</a>)</p>

<p>That we gather, each into himself, the
curious dual power and Janus-faced majesty
in mischief of the prophet that prophesies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
falsely, and the priest that bears rule by his
means (<a href="#VIII">Letter VIII.</a>)</p>

<p>That we do not exercise discipline by keeping
wicked people out of church (<a href="#VI">Letter VI.</a>)</p>

<p>That we do not require each member of our
flocks to tell us what they do to earn their
dinners (<a href="#IX">Letter IX.</a>)</p>

<p>That we encourage people in hypocrisy, by
inviting them to the authorized mockery of a
confession of sin (<a href="#X">Letter X.</a>)</p>

<p>I cannot examine the evidence which Mr.
Ruskin possesses in support of these charges,
as he has not produced it in these Letters.
Neither can I attempt to refute the accusations.
To prove a negative is always difficult;
it becomes an impossible task when the indictment
is laid not against any individuals
mentioned by name, but against a whole order.
I will only observe, that even if all these
charges be true, the people of England are
not in such evil case as Mr. Ruskin fancies.
The laity of England possess the inestimable
advantage of not being dependent on the
sermons of their clergy for either doctrine,
or correction, or instruction in righteousness.
Even though a clergyman should never utter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
certain doctrines of Christ from the pulpit,
or reprove certain sins, he is obliged to do
so at the font, at the lectern, and at the altar.
Although from the pulpits of the fifty hundreds
of clergy whom Mr. Ruskin heard, he
never heard so much as <i>one</i> clergyman heartily
proclaiming that no covetous person, which
is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the
kingdom of God, he must have often heard
this proclamation from the altar, in the epistle
for the third Sunday in Lent, and from the
lectern whenever the fifth chapter of the
Epistle to the Ephesians is read for the
lesson.</p>

<p>Again, if any clergyman teaches from the
pulpit that for the redemption of the world
people ought to be thankful, not to the Father,
but to the Son (<a href="#V">Letter V.</a>), he is obliged to
publicly contradict his own teaching as often
as he says the General Thanksgiving, and the
collects in the Book of Common Prayer.</p>

<p>Again, if any clergyman teaches from the
pulpit that any one who does evil is good in
the sight of the Lord, or that there is any
other salvation except a salvation from sin, he
is obliged to publicly contradict that teaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
by everything which he says in the church
out of the pulpit.</p>

<p>Again, if any clergyman preaches away the
penalties of sin (<a href="#VIII">Letter VIII.</a>), he is obliged to
publicly contradict his preaching every Ash
Wednesday, when he reads the general sentences
of God's cursing against impenitent
sinners.</p>

<p>Mr. Ruskin asks (<a href="#III">Letter III.</a>), "Can this
Gospel of Christ be put into such plain words
and short terms as that a plain man may
understand it?" I answer that the English
Church has tried to do this in the Catechism,
in which every baptized child is taught in
very simple and plain words the gospel, or
good news, that God the Father has, in His
Son Jesus Christ, adopted him or her into
His family, and therein offers him or her the
continual help of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>Mr. Ruskin complains that the clergy do
not teach the people the meaning of the Lord's
Prayer (<a href="#VI">Letter VI.</a>) He must assume that
the clergy neglect to teach children the
Church Catechism, in which is an answer to
the question, "What desirest thou of God in
this prayer?" It is an answer which would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
probably satisfy Mr. Ruskin. He would see
that "Hallowed be Thy name" does not
merely mean that people ought to abstain from
bad language. And in the explanation of the
third commandment, he would see that something
more is forbidden than letting out a
round oath (<a href="#VI">Letter VI.</a>)</p>

<p>Mr. Ruskin complains that the clergy do
not prevent the entrance among their congregations
of persons leading openly wicked lives
(<a href="#VI">Letter VI.</a>) Before this can be charged on
the clergy as a sin, he should show that
they have power and authority to do this.
In the service for Ash Wednesday he will
find that the clergy express their desire for
a restoration of the godly discipline of the
primitive Church, which Mr. Ruskin also
desires. But he ought to know that such
restoration must be the work not of the
clergy only, but of the whole body of the
faithful.</p>

<p>Mr. Ruskin insinuates that the clergy have
no clear idea of their calling (<a href="#III">Letter III.</a>) If
this be so, it is certainly not the fault of the
Church, seeing that the nature of the calling
of a clergyman is plainly set forth in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
Offices for the Ordering of Bishops, Priests,
and Deacons. But if one may form an opinion
from many published sermons by English
clergymen of various schools of thought, and
from their speeches in Church Congresses and
elsewhere, and from their pastoral work as
parish priests, I should be inclined to think
that they are not quite so ignorant of the
nature of their calling and of the Gospel of
Christ as Mr. Ruskin supposes them to be,
and that of some of the sins, negligences, and
ignorances which, in these Letters, he lays
to their charge, they may plead not guilty, or
at least not proven by Mr. Ruskin.</p>

<span class="right"><i>November 3rd</i></span>, 1879.
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Malleson</span>,&mdash;I thank you for
your letter, which I received this morning.
Second thoughts are not always the best.
Your own first thought about the motto which
I prefixed to my notes was right; your second
thought was wrong. It never occurred to me
that anyone could possibly suppose that that
motto was by me intended to be applied to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
myself, inasmuch as in these notes there is
no "wound" inflicted on Mr. Ruskin, or even
any "rebuke." On the contrary, I assume
that he has evidence in support of his charges,
although he has not produced it. The "rebuke"
to which I alluded was <i>Mr. Ruskin's</i>
rebuke. <i>He</i> is the "friend" whose wounds
are faithful, and whose smitings are a kindness.
For I have not the least doubt of his
good-will towards the clergy, or of his earnest
desire to see them all performing their sacred
duties with zeal and knowledge. And it was
as my acknowledgment of this that I prefixed
the motto. With you I firmly believe that
the standard which he takes is "lofty and
Christian," and that it is one towards which
we ought all of us to aim. The object of my
notes was to show that the laity of England
have, in the authorized teaching of the Church,
a sufficient safeguard against any erroneous
teaching which they may possibly hear from
the pulpit or in the private ministrations of
the clergy, and also a supplement to any
defective teaching.</p>

<p>The words "Thy will be done" are generally
coupled with resignation, and very often with
patience under chastisement. It is always to
us a sad-coloured sentence, and a sentimental
illuminator of the Lord's Prayer would in all
probability make it so. Now, if we think for
a moment what the state of things would be
if the will of the Lord were done, we shall see
it should be the brightest sentence we could
conceive. God's will is our weal. Aspiration,
not resignation, is the characteristic of its
doing. There would certainly be no death,&mdash;that
is decidedly contrary to His will; and
by-and-by, when His will is done, there will
be none. For the present, while His will is
not yet done, we have the sure and certain
hope that death will be&mdash;nay, is&mdash;conquered
by anticipation.</p>

<p>If His will were done, all beautiful things
would flourish, and all minds would answeringly
rejoice in them.</p>

<p>Our men of the piercing eye&mdash;Turners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
Hunts, Ruskins, etc.&mdash;show us, till we almost
worship the state of things in cloud and mountain,
river and sea, in hedgerow and wayside,
even in cathedral and campanile, where God's
will is done, and we are enchanted with their
beauty. It is God's will that stones should be
laid truly and carven well, and aptly described.
And our men of the probe and the lens, the
scientific openers of nature's secrets, are daily
demonstrating new beauties in which the will
of the Lord is done in the formation of bodies
and working of forces. It is mere truism to
add to this that the will of the Lord being
done, none of the ills that are all of them indirectly
or directly the result of not doing it
could occur, and resignation would have no
scope for exercise. There was One who
always did it, and He for three years made
sundry parts of Palestine a heaven,&mdash;with what
results a many quondam poor folk testified.
This leads me to say that I like to look upon
the word heaven as a participle instead of a
noun, as the state of being heaved or raised,
rather than a place: and for this reason. The
experience of every one of us suffices to
prove that we are never so <i>heaven</i>, or raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
in true happiness, moral dignity, and worth, as
when we are in the company of one greater,
wiser, or better than ourselves. Those who
lead a humdrum life among mean persons,
can testify what a heaven it is to be transplanted
for ever so short a time to the company
of a great and good man. Now the
culminating, indeed all-absorbing, attraction
of the heaven we all look to, is the presence
and the companionship of the greatest and
best; and the experience of ourselves tallies
with the promise of St. John that it will
have the effect of making us "like Him,"
when "we shall see Him as He is." Surely
being <i>heaven</i>, or raised like that, is superior
to any Mahomet's paradise that we can invent
or distil out of the poetical parts of the
Scriptures.</p>

<p>Mr. Ruskin's view as to the duty of basing
all upon the Father's love is essentially sound
and orthodox; and he is also right in bidding
all men lead self-denying lives,&mdash;in this sense,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
that they should give up time and labour to
the endeavour to help their brethren; but
he fails utterly, hopelessly, to realize the Incarnation
and its glorious consequences, how
all human life and love,&mdash;how art, science,
knowledge, enjoyment, are sanctified by God's
becoming man; sharing this human life of
ours,&mdash;not to trample upon it as an unholy
thing, but to consecrate it to God's service.
Such is our call. We must enjoy the beautiful
to vindicate enjoyment. We do not
please God by casting all His choicest gifts
away. To give all we have to feed the
poor is the way to make men poor, and is
false charity. Use rather the mammon of
this world to God's honour and glory, and
when ye fail, the good works that you
have done shall plead for your entrance
into everlasting habitations; for the way to
clothe the naked and feed the hungry, permanently,
is to teach men and women to
help themselves, and to find employment and
reward for the exercise of their powers and
energies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span></p>

<p>To Mr. Ruskin, then, asking us to define
ourselves as a body, I reply, We are presbyters
and deacons, deriving our authority
from the episcopate, who themselves form
links in that spiritual chain which binds
both ourselves and them, by perpetual succession,
in one communion and fellowship, with
the Apostles, and to whom has been committed
the office of consecrating and sending forth
labourers to work in the Lord's vineyard.</p>

<p>But Mr. Ruskin proceeds, "And our business
as such." Our business as such! Well,
if we have in any satisfactory manner proved
our first point&mdash;<i>that</i> is, the authority with which
we act&mdash;we may fairly say to Mr. Ruskin, "Do
you put this question, 'What is your business?'
to your lawyer or doctor?" Does he
ask the same question of the clergy of any other
portion of the Catholic Church? We shall not
wish to insult Mr. Ruskin by attempting to
explain to him the duties of the priesthood,
with which, doubtless, he is well acquainted.</p>

<p>But he asks, "Do we look upon ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
as attached to any particular State, and bound
to the promulgation of any particular tenets?"
We are undoubtedly attached to the particular
sphere to the which we are sent by
those whose office is to provide the various
parts of God's vineyard with labourers. The
Anglican Church is the legitimate representative
of the Catholic Church of Christ in
England; and we, as clergy of this Church,
minister for the most part to our countrymen
at home, and only in other countries as the
necessities of our colonists and others may
require. And, as subscribers to the Prayer
Book and priests of the Church of England,
we are certainly bound to teach faithfully
and honestly her doctrines, neither adding to
them nor taking away from them according
to our own individual idiosyncrasies.</p>

admired Ruskin, and learn much even when
I most differ from him. But if I had the good
fortune to be with you to-morrow, I fear that
I should constantly be demurring to his teaching,&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>
(<a href="#III">Letter III.</a>) his supposition that
the Thirty-nine Articles were meant to include
a summary of the Gospel; (<a href="#V">Letter V.</a>)
his belief that there is need now to warn men
against being thankful not to the Father but
only to the Son,&mdash;a remnant of the teaching
of his youth; (<a href="#Page_20">p. 20</a>) his hard way of speaking
as to the Son of Man, Whose human soul, as
that of perfect man, received its knowledge in
steps according to His own will as perfect
God; (<a href="#VII">Letter VII.</a>) his confused distinction
between the Kingdom of God and the Kingdom
of Christ (see Eph. v. 5 in the Greek, and
remember "<i>tradendo tenet</i>" on 1 Cor. xv. 24);
his belief that because no one knoweth the
hour of Christ's coming, it cannot be hastened
by prayer; (<a href="#VIII">Letter VIII.</a>) his seeming identification
of claiming interest from a poor man
who is in need and necessity, and from a railway
company who borrow money to make
more,&mdash;speaking, as far as I can see, of money
as if it had no market value like other things;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
(<a href="#X">Letter X.</a>) the belief that we clergy are not

X.</a>) the inability to see that the nearer and
nearer by God's grace we come, in answer
to prayer, to purity and holiness, the more we
<i>realize</i> our distance from them; and that his
objection to our Liturgy might be adapted into
one against the Lord's Prayer, in which we
pray daily for forgiveness of sins, and deliverance
from evil, showing that we never shall
be so delivered as no longer to need forgiveness;
(<a href="#XI">Letter XI.</a>) the supposition that any
one state of life is necessarily more full of
temptations than another, as though the fruit
of a tree were not to Eve what the glory of
the world was to the Son of Man, at least in
the eye of the Tempter.</p>

<p>I am ashamed to jot down thus obscurely
the points on which I should have liked to
speak, and I know that our brethren can fully
deal with them. On the other hand (<a href="#VIII">Letter
VIII.</a>) there is much to move us, and lead to
searchings of heart. As to the timidity and
coldness with which the Church is attacking
the crying sins of our day, one often feels
how we need some among us to speak as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
prophets did to the men of their generation,
and we may be thankful to have our shortcomings
brought home to us by words like

<p>I wish I were not writing so hurriedly.</p>

<p>Remember me most affectionately to all my

<p>[<span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;<i>March 12th</i> 1880:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Malleson has kindly brought this letter
of mine again before me. Hasty and concise
as it was, I have no wish to expand it, as Mr.
Ruskin's Letters are now <i>publici juris</i>, and in
the hands of many a critic, who will rejoice
to deal with them according to his wisdom. I
should be thankful, however, for leave to add
a few words on one point. I cannot help
having misgivings as to whether I was right
in demurring without hesitation to "the supposition
that one state of life is necessarily
more free from temptations than another," for
I well know that in favour of such a supposition
there is a strong <i>consensus</i> of just men.
I am, however, one of those who believe that
the shorter Beatitude, "Blessed be ye poor,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
(Luke vi. 20) is explained by the longer,
"Blessed are the poor in spirit." I see, also,
that the difficulty with which "they that have
riches" enter the kingdom of God is reasserted
with a qualification in the very next verse,
which speaks of those "who trust in riches"
(St. Mark x. 23, 24). "Who then can be
saved?" asked the disciples, who, poor men
indeed themselves, first heard of this difficulty,
instinctively perceiving, it may be, that it has
its root in temptations from which in one shape
or other no one is free. I read that "the cares
of this world," as well as "the deceitfulness
of riches," choke the Word; and I am sure
that into the number of those "who will be
rich," or "who are wishing to be rich," and
so "fall into temptation," a poor man may but
too easily find his way. I like to remember
that when "the beggar died," he was carried
into the bosom of one who had been "very
rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold;" and I
think that very deep and far-stretching may
be the meaning of the words of the wise man,
"The rich and poor meet together, and the
Lord is the Maker of them all."]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Ruskin's Letters have already been
closely scrutinized. What have seemed to
be blemishes in them have been commented
on. They have been spoken of as somewhat
random utterances&mdash;as utterances such as are
pardonable in a layman, but would be inexcusable
in a clergyman who should endeavour
to instruct his brethren. It has been said of
them that they manifest a want of knowledge
of teaching constantly being given from Church
of England pulpits. It would be quite possible
for the present paper to be devoted to a
continuation of the like free criticism of the
Letters. I might ask, for instance, whether
Mr. Ruskin, after (in <a href="#V">Letter V.</a>) speaking with
condemnation of a plan of salvation which sets
forth the Divine Son as appeasing the wrath
of the Father in heaven, does not himself give
expression to words, as to the love of the
Father, which almost imply that in his estimation
the Divine mind is not in unity in
itself? I might further ask for Mr. Ruskin
to put more definiteness into his remarks on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
usury, and to particularize the special forms of
that condemnable practice which the clergy
should boldly denounce. The few hints which
he throws out on this subject show that to his
own thoughts there is present an exalted
socialism. He himself in previous writings,
while shadowing forth a social system based
on unselfishness, has carefully deprecated any
revolutionary attempt to hasten the establishment
of such a system, and would prefer that
it should be waited for while it quietly and
with orderliness evolves itself out of the
present imperfect order of things. Is it not so
evolving itself? Does not the co-operative
movement, now steadily advancing, spring out
of the recognition of the fact that mutual
welfare is a far more excellent thing to be
attained than the enrichment of the few at the
expense of the many? And if, with regard to
the land question, any readjustment of relations
is made, will it not be made in the light
of the same beneficent principle? If, however,
the clergy were to give heed to Mr. Ruskin's
words, and at once proceed to the indiscriminate
excommunication of usurers, would they
not be initiating a social revolution, altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
different from that orderly upgrowth of a
better state of things which has commended
itself aforetime to Mr. Ruskin himself? My
own impression is that I shall be giving voice
to a wish that will spring up wherever Mr.
Ruskin's Letters may be read, if I say that
a clearer, more definite utterance on the usury
question would be welcomed. The clergy
everywhere would receive with thankfulness
any hints as to how they might hasten the
coming of the day when the Church of Christ
will no longer embrace within her borders
the few, with a useless excess of wealth, and
around them the unhappy many, hopelessly,
squalidly destitute; along, too, with a vast
number of toiling teachers, clergy, artists,
and literary workers, living mostly on the
verge of pennilessness&mdash;men of whose existence
Mr. Ruskin has, in earlier writings, expressed
himself as keenly and sympathetically
conscious.</p>

<p>But I will not linger on such parts of Mr.
Ruskin's Letters as may seem to display inconsistency,
or to need more precision of
language before they can be practically useful.
I will proceed to speak of those for which, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
it seems to me, the clergy may unhesitatingly
be very grateful to Mr. Ruskin for laying them
before them.</p>

<p>And first, I think we cannot be other than
thankful to Mr. Ruskin for sounding at the
outset a note of catholicity. He asks the
clergy of the English Church (let me say he
asks us,&mdash;he asks you and me), whether we
look upon ourselves as the clergy of a mere
insular Church, or as the clergy of the Church
Universal. Is the teaching we are continually
giving utterance to as to the conduct of life in
harmony with, or different from, the teaching
of the Christian Churches on the Continent of
Europe? Mr. Ruskin's tone, in asking these
questions, is such as implies that it would be
no satisfaction to him to hear from us that we
rejoice in considering ourselves as severed
from the clergy of the Christian Church abroad.
Indeed, he goes on to assume that we, with
one consenting voice, admit our fellowship
with the rest of Christendom&mdash;that we recognize
as our brothers the clergy of the Church
of France, and of the Church of Italy, and of
the Church everywhere.</p>

<p>Mr. Ruskin thus does not lend the support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
of his name to any useless Protestantism.
There are senses in which the whole Christian
Church must ever be a Protestant Church,
and in which even individual members may
from time to time raise protesting voices.
The Church must ever lift up her protest
against all influences that work in the world
for evil&mdash;against whatsoever tends to overthrow
the Christian ideals of individual,
family, social, national, and international life.
She must protest against all hindrances, even
though they may spring up within her own
borders, which tend to prevent her from
putting any beneficent impress upon human
handiwork and upon manifestations of human
genius. She must protest against the very
Protestantism in her midst which has served
to paganize art and to demoralize the drama,
by banishing both to an outer region of darkness
which Gospel rays cannot be expected
to illumine. She must protest vigorously
against the mischievous Protestantism which
impoverishes the intellect and chills the affections,
by causing men to devote the whole
energies of their lives to protesting against
systems of thought with which they are very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
imperfectly acquainted, and to maintaining an
attitude of perpetual suspicion as to others'
aims and motives. Under the influence of
such Protestantism as this, many have been
possessed with the assurance that a vast
number of the clergy of Christendom live for
no other end than to conspire against freedom,
to disseminate falsities, and to work ruin
amongst human souls. This Protestantism is
fast ceasing to have any power amongst us;
still, as it is not quite extinct, it is comforting
to find that Mr. Ruskin does not attribute it
to the main body of those whom he addresses.</p>

<p>To me it seems that an habitual protesting
attitude on the part of those who are called
upon to be the teachers of the Church implies
that they have not themselves properly entered
the temple of Christian truth. He to whom
Christian doctrine has revealed itself in all its
wondrous harmony cannot do other than devote
himself to unfolding to others what is
ever present to his own mind, so that he may
aid in building up their thoughts consistently
and symmetrically, and thus help to establish
them firmly in the Christian faith.</p>

<p>We may, then, it seems to me, express our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
thankfulness that Mr. Ruskin has spoken,
though ever so briefly, a word of encouragement
to the clergy of the English Church
amongst whom the thought of a future of reunion
for Christendom has been welcomed.
Mr. Ruskin is familiar with the practical working
of the Christian Church in Italy and elsewhere
on the Continent, and seeing, as he has
seen, that her influence is exerted towards
securing an orderly and healthy state of
social life, he does not give circulation to the
indiscriminate calumnies which were once wont
to be uttered, and which were alike at variance
with the truth and provocative of a mischievous
severance of Christians from one another.</p>

<p>But we must, I think, be more especially
grateful to Mr. Ruskin for his calling widespread
attention to the great Christian doctrine
of the Fatherhood of God. There is
especial need for this being uplifted before the
thoughts of men at the present day, and it is
being so uplifted. The more it is upheld, the
more fully will it be discerned. It cannot be
said that the doctrine is not accepted within
the English Church. Still, it has not yet
been received in all its fulness. Amongst the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
separatists outside the borders of our Church,
the doctrine that God is the Father of all
humanity, and the loving Father too, is rejected
in two extreme ways. The set of
"believers" who adopt the one extreme view
consider that the Lord's Prayer&mdash;so luminous,
as Mr. Ruskin reminds us, with the thought
of God's fatherly love&mdash;should be used only
by the elect, such as themselves, and that
all others have no right to address God as
their Father. The other set of so-called
"believers" considers with a deplorable Pharisaism
that they have arrived at such a stage
of perfection as to be beyond the need for
using words which require them to ask
every day for forgiveness of their trespasses.
Why should they ask for such, they
say, when their trespasses are non-existent?
If they are children of the Father they are
not so in the same sense as those who
conscientiously use the prayer addressed to
the Father in heaven. I regret that Mr.
Ruskin's facile pen has betrayed him into
writing some words with reference to our
Liturgy which bring him momentarily into
sympathy with these self-righteous ones who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
have no need to confess that they want more
health of soul.</p>

<p>But the doctrine of the loving Fatherhood of
God, as revealed to us in Christ, is one that
is unfolding itself more and more clearly to
the Christian world. If it has unfolded itself
to us we may aid in its increased discernment.
It is one that involves the acceptance
of the thought that all human life and every
sphere of human endeavour are under Divine
patronage. God is in every way our Father.
All human excellences whatsoever exist in
their fulness and perfection in Him. As they
are manifested in us and in our brothers
and sisters around us, they are Divine excellences
becoming incarnate on the realm of
humanity.</p>

<p>Childhood, for instance, as it manifests its
sweetness and winsomeness in Christian homes,
is an outcome of the eternal childhood which
dwells in God, and which was manifested
supremely to the world in the life of the
Divine Child at Bethlehem and Nazareth.</p>

<p>So that the doctrine of the loving Fatherhood
of God has sheltering beneath it the thought
of the divineness of childhood. Clustering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
with it are many kindred thoughts. There is
the divineness of youth, the frankness of
Christian boyhood, the tender grace of Christian
girlhood,&mdash;these are manifestations of the
eternal youth abiding in the Divine Lord of
humanity.</p>

<p>I might speak to you in like manner of the
divineness of manhood and of womanhood,
and of the divineness of old age. All womanly
excellences, as well as all manly virtues, reside
in the Divine One. I might speak to you of
the divineness of wedded life, the divineness
of Christian fatherliness and motherliness.
The divineness of the student's life and of the
teacher's life might also be dwelt upon. The
divineness of the ministry of reconciliation, in
which ministry all may take part who help
others to separate themselves from sin and
selfishness and to enter into union with God
and His life of love,&mdash;this I present to you as
a fruitful thought. The divineness of all efforts
tending towards the solace and comforting of
suffering human souls,&mdash;that too is one of
the beneficent thoughts involved in the great
Christian truth that God is the Father of
humanity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span></p>

<p>But the same great truth leads us to the
discernment of other useful thoughts. I might
speak of them as connected with the divineness
of all toil which has for its object the
increase of human knowledge, the gathering
together of the stored-up lessons of the past,
the beautifying of the daily life, the refining
and spiritualizing of the daily thoughts of the
great brotherhood and sisterhood. It would
thus be quite justifiable to speak of the divineness
of scientific toil, inasmuch as that has for
its aim the unfolding of the thoughts of God,
of which all appearances of the material world
are the outcome and manifestation. Thus too
I might speak of the divineness of the work
of those who enable us to see the results of
the Divine guidance bestowed on the world in
the ages past. I might speak of the divineness
of the work of the artist who devotes
himself to acquiring skill in subtly entangling
in the colours he puts on canvas the sentiment
underlying the landscape he reverently looks
at, which to him is a manifestation of a
heaven of beauty unseen by heedless eyes. I
might also speak of the divineness of the
labours of the Christian poet, who presents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
to the world truth in its feminine and most
winning aspects.</p>

<p>When I should have spoken of all these
things they could all be summed up into one
phrase&mdash;the divineness of Humanity. And
this is what I have faintly attempted to show
necessarily springs up for recognition as the
doctrine of the Fatherhood of God presents
itself to us in all its impressiveness.</p>

<p>I must hasten to a close. I have said
that Mr. Ruskin in what he asks us with
reference to our relation to the Church in
other countries sounds a note of catholicity.
In what I have myself said as to Protestantism
I have urged nothing inconsistent
with a thorough loyalty to the principle of
Christian individualism. But individualism
in utter revolt against authority leads only to
confusion and to a multiplicity of tyrannies.
Individualism thrives best under the protection
of a generous all-embracing authority.
Individualism before taking up the attitude
of revolt should consider that it, by brave
patience and a reverent submissiveness to all
higher influences around it, may contribute
beneficently to the authority of the future,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
and increase the generousness and catholicity
of its sway.</p>

<p>I will further remark that Mr. Ruskin's
words as to the Fatherhood of God are also a
catholic utterance. For the Fatherhood of God
when pondered upon helps us to see that no
sphere of human effort is beyond His control;
that His house is one of many mansions of
thought and affection and loving toil; that His
heavenly kingdom is one including all domains
on which human energies can be directed, over
which human thoughts can roam, on which
human love can lavish itself.</p>

<i>From the Rev.</i> <span class="smcap">Canon E. H. M'Neile</span>,
<i>Liverpool</i>.</h4>


<p>What is the exact question asked in <a href="#II">Letter
II.</a>?</p>

<p>Is it whether the clergy are or are not
teachers of universal science?</p>

<p>If so, we answer, Yes, we are teachers of
the science most universal of all, namely, the
knowledge of God, which is eternal life: and of
the way to attain it, which is holiness; and the
principles of this science, which are universal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
are not, as in other sciences, discovered by
human research, but are revealed by God.</p>

<p>Does the question imply that there are
points of science on which it is of no consequence
what opinions a teacher holds? And
if so, does it further mean that all matters of
doctrine, such as are defined in the Thirty-nine
Articles, are of this nature?</p>

<p>If so, I answer that it is only the theories
or speculations of scientific investigators about
which variety of opinion is immaterial, not the
essential principles of the science; and that we
cannot exclude all questions of doctrine from
among those principles. I do not know
what is meant by holding different opinions
on points of science. About the facts of
science there can be no difference of opinion;
but there may be about the bearings, and the
inferences to be drawn from them.</p>


<div class="smcapcent"><a href="#III">Letter III</a></div>

<p>Here is a definite question. My answer is,
Yes, but we do not refer to the Thirty-nine
Articles for a statement of the Gospel, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
rather to the Apostles' Creed, which contains
the simplest summary of the facts on which
the Gospel rests. (See 1 Cor. xv. 1, etc.)</p>


<div class="smcapcent"><a href="#IV">Letter IV</a></div>

<p>Here I answer, No. The Lord's Prayer was
not intended to be a statement of the Gospel,
but the language of those who have accepted
it. No doubt the terms of the prayer may
be so explained as to bring in a definition
of the Gospel, working backwards; but a
complete explanation would be longer than
the Thirty-nine Articles. There seems to be
a serious confusion of thought here between
the offer of salvation to sinners estranged
from God, and the utterance towards God of
His reconciled children.</p>


<div class="smcapcent"><a href="#V">Letter V</a></div>

<p>The Lord's Prayer is elementary teaching
for Christians, but it is not the first thing to
be taught to those outside the family of God.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
The truth that we have a Father in heaven
is a fundamental part of the Gospel. It is
assumed in the Lord's Prayer; and so is the
further truth that our Father of His tender
love towards us has given His Son to die for
us, that we may be delivered from the "consuming
fire" which sin, not God, has kindled;
and thus we have indeed a blessed scheme of
pardon for which we are to be thankful to <i>both</i>
the Father and the Son. This makes <i>all</i> the
clauses of the apostolic blessing intelligible
and living.</p>


<div class="smcapcent"><a href="#VI">Letter VI</a></div>

<p><a href="#For_other">Page 14</a>: "For <i>other</i> sins," etc. I think
this is an incorrect comment. The force of
the threat is positive, not comparative. The
language of the law is similar towards every
sin.</p>

<p>In what is said about the abomination of
hypocrisy in prayer we cordially agree. God
give us grace to avoid it ourselves, and to
warn our brethren faithfully against it! But
in what follows there is an assumption of a
power of discipline which the clergy do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
possess, and which I fear the laity would
be most unwilling to concede to them.
Mr. Ruskin seems also to slip into the old
error of the servants in the parable of the
tares.</p>


<div class="smcapcent"><a href="#VII">Letter VII</a></div>

<p>On <a href="#Page_21">page 21</a> St. John xiv. 9 is incorrectly
cited, and it is difficult to know the exact drift
of the writer.</p>

<p>I object to the statement that "in all His
relations to us and commands to us," etc.
(See, <i>e.g.</i>, St. Matt. xxviii. 18-20.)</p>

<p>As to His not knowing whether His prayer
could be heard, see St. John xi. 41, 42.</p>

<p>I think it is incorrect to say that our Lord
Himself <i>used</i> the prayer He gave us, at least
in its entirety as it stands.</p>

<p>Pages <a href="#Page_20">20</a>, <a href="#Page_21">21</a>: Mr. Ruskin seems to me to
draw most strongly the very comparison to
which he objects. Surely the kingdom of
Christ <i>is</i> the kingdom of His Father. (Rev.
xi. 15, xii. 10; Eph. v. 5.) Does not an unwillingness
to accept the true divinity of our
Lord underlie this passage?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span></p>


<div class="smcapcent"><a href="#VIII">Letter VIII</a></div>

<p><a href="#Page_25">Page 25</a>: There is surely a mistake here.
Personal sanctification and national prosperity
are very different things. A nation has no
existence except in this world; therefore its
prosperity is the chief end to be aimed at;
and this is no doubt promoted by the holiness
of its people. But a man has another life
hereafter; and comfort and wealth are not the
end of his being. If granted, they are means
to his sanctification, not <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p>It seems to me that Mr. Ruskin in this
Letter writes somewhat recklessly, and that
he must have been singularly unfortunate in
his experience of preachers if he has never
heard a faithful sermon against covetousness,
which is the idolatry of our age. On <a href="#Page_26">page 26</a>
he seems to fall into a great error in supposing
that the proclamation of a free pardon
for sin tends to encourage it. If a man is
to be delivered from the power of his sins,
he must first be delivered from the guilt of
them.</p>

<p>No doubt the grace of God has been abused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
by some; and St. Paul himself felt that his
doctrine was open to such abuse (Rom. vi.
1, 15). It is not, I think, just to attribute the
corruption of our great cities to the teaching
of the clergy. It is rather to be ascribed to
the absence of that teaching.</p>


<div class="smcapcent"><a href="#X">Letter X</a></div>

<p>Whatever justice there may be (and no
doubt there is much) in Mr. Ruskin's accusations
against us clergy, he is surely under
an entire misapprehension in the charge which
he here makes against our Liturgy.</p>

<p>Our Prayer Book is doubtless constructed
for the use of believing Christians, and is not
fitted for the impenitent; but its adaptation
to the needs of the repentant publican and
of the advanced Christian is most wonderful.
And that a form of prayer may be so adapted
is surely proved by the Lord's Prayer itself,
which Mr. Ruskin says is the <i>first</i> thing to be
taught to all, and which, with all his practice
in thinking, he feels that he cannot adequately
expound.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span></p>

<p>Surely the repetition of a confession of unholiness
casts no slur upon the efficacy of our
prayers for holiness when we recognize that
holiness is progressive, and that spiritual
growth may express itself not merely in new
words, but in a heartier utterance of the
old ones. As to the particular expression,
"there is no health in us," it needs either
the explanation of St. Paul&mdash;"I know that
in me, <i>that is, in my flesh</i>, dwelleth no
good thing,"&mdash;or else to be understood according
to the old meaning of "health,"
viz., "<i>saving health</i>," <i>salvation</i>, <i>deliverance</i>
(Psalm cxix. 123, Prayer Book; Isa. lviii. 8;
Jer. viii. 15).</p>

<p>It needs further to be remarked that repentance
is not only a single definite act, but a
state of mind.</p>

<p>I think that underlying all these comments
of Mr. Ruskin on the Lord's Prayer is a failure
to recognize the truth of man's fall.</p>

<p>Human nature is a ruin, not to be restored
by a rearrangement of its fragments. God
has provided a remedy, by sending His Son
to be the foundation of a new spiritual building;
and every man who is to be built upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
that foundation must himself become a new
creature by the operation of the Holy Ghost.
All efforts to improve humanity in the mass,
without the renewal of each separate soul,
must fail; and no doubt the clergy often fall
into this mistake.</p>

<p>The Lord's Prayer is not the prayer of
all mankind as they are by nature. It is a
prayer to the possession of which they are
brought by regeneration, and to the enjoyment
by conversion.</p>

<h4><i>From the Rev.</i> <span class="smcap">P. T. Ouvry</span>.</h4>

<p>On the meaning of usury, I would add
a few words. I start with this proposition.
There is nothing contrary to the will of God
for one free man to buy from another free
man anything he wants. I have two houses,&mdash;one
I live in, one I let. My tenant pays
the market rent of houses to me, and so both
parties are benefited. I have two thousand
pounds. I have no capacity, or opportunity,
or desire to use more than one thousand
pounds in trade on my own account. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
neighbour has energy and activity to use more
money than he has in trade. He gladly
offers me five per cent. for my spare thousand
pounds. I willingly lend it on those terms.
He makes ten per cent. by using it. He
gives me five pounds and has five pounds for
himself. If this be usury, it is lawful and
right.</p>

<p>A number of small cultivators of land have
no capital. A money-lender supplies what
they require on condition that they sell their
crops to him at a price which he is able to
fix. From the circumstances of the case the
money-lender makes an enormous profit. The
cultivator has barely the necessaries of life.
This is usury, in the bad sense of the term,
but is more correctly called oppression or
extortion.</p>

<p>Again, a man lends money to ignorant inexperienced
youths, on promise of repayment
when they come of age. This, too, is oppression
or extortion.</p>

<p>Similar oppression is witnessed when bad
houses are let to poor people at high rents.</p>

<p>It is not, then, that usury, in the sense
of oppression or extortion, is inherent in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
money-lending; but it belongs equally to every
transaction between man and man, where any
unrighteous dealing is practised.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Malleson</span>,&mdash;I protested strongly
yesterday against our remarks, made on the
spur of the moment, being printed and submitted
to Mr. Ruskin's criticism, and what I
said then I feel as strongly still.</p>

<p>But I have no objection to send, as a
comment on his Letters, a volume of sermons
which I published last year, because I think
that, in that upon the hallowing of God's
name, I have not taken the restricted view
which Mr. Ruskin accused the clergy of
taking, and I think also that (except in the
sermon upon the doctrine of the Trinity,
which was written before the others, and is
tinged with the prejudices of early training),
I have set forth God the Father as a Being
of infinite, tender, fatherly love.</p>

<p>So far as snails may follow in the footsteps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
of greyhounds, and bats look in the same
direction as eagles, I think some of us clergymen
are getting our feet and our eyes into
the same track as Mr. Ruskin's.</p>

<p>It seems to me that all of us who think
upon religious matters, laity or clergy, whether
men of genius or commonplace people, are
feeling our way at present to something better
and truer. Men like Mr. Ruskin, like steamships,
dart on to their destination; and feebler
minds, like sailing vessels, are a good deal
at the mercy of the <i>popularis aura</i> and the
winds of doctrine, but both are on their way
to the same point.</p>

<p>I send the volume by the same post as this
letter.</p>

<h4><i>From the Rev.</i> <span class="smcap">A. G. K. Simpson</span>,
 <i>Brighton</i>.</h4>

<p>We are convinced that the love of God is
the originating cause of all His dealings with
mankind, and are glad to meet him on the
broad platform of "Our Father which art in
heaven;" only premising that it is a platform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
not new to us, but on which we have long
taken our stand.</p>

<p>But beyond these somewhat general statements
of our faith, I doubt whether it would
be possible to put Divine truth into such
plain words as would meet with general
acceptance. In proportion to the <i>minuteness</i>
would be the <i>disagreement</i>. To take
one great truth (perhaps the greatest of
all), would it be possible to put forth a plain
and simple statement, such as all, or the
majority, would receive, of the Atonement?
Such a mind as Mr. Ruskin's would not be
content with the forensic view more popular
some years ago than now. Wiser, it seems
to me, it is to accept some such teaching
as that of Coleridge in "Aids to Reflection."
"The mysterious act, the operative
cause," he says, "is transcendent." "<i>Factum
est</i>," and beyond the information contained
in the enunciation of the fact, it can be characterized
only by its consequences. It is these
consequences which (according to Coleridge)
are illustrated by the four metaphors:&mdash;</p>

<p>
1. Sin-offering or expiation.<br />
<br />
2. Reconciliation.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span><br />
3. Redemption.<br />
<br />
4. Payment of a debt.<br />
</p>

<p>Now, would not a plain, a simple statement,
be apt to press the metaphor too far, and
attempt to put into words one aspect of the
truth as though it were the whole? Such a
reverent mind as Bishop Butler's reproved
the curiosity which sought to find out the
manner of the atonement. "I do not find,"
he said, "that it is declared in the Scriptures."
And yet the atonement is only <i>one</i>, though
perhaps the <i>chief</i>, of the many points of which
a true and simple statement must take cognizance.
It would be comparatively easy for
the private clergyman to put into words his
thoughts on this subject or that, but then he
would be continually liable to have it urged
against him that he had not sufficiently considered
some given point&mdash;had not walked
round it, and seen it in all its bearings; that
his view was inadequate and incomplete;
and, being fallible and human, some of the
objections would doubtless be true, and the
simple and plain statement be, in that respect
at least, misguiding.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span></p>


<h4><i>From the Rev.</i> <span class="smcap">G. W. Wall</span>,
<i>Bickerstaffe.</i></h4>

<div class="smcapcent"><a href="#II">Letter II</a></div>

<p>This Letter professes to contain an "exact
question," which is somewhat singularly inexactly
put. In its strict grammatical form
it asks for a definition of the members of a
Clerical Council, and their business as such.
This "exact question" is in fact an illustration
of the fallacy of asking two questions in one,
though a question demanding to be answered
with "mathematical" precision should have
been set with mathematical accuracy. But here
at the outset a protest must be entered against
being called upon to answer a question set
in ambiguous words and misleading phrases,
and based upon assumptions which those
questioned would reject. It is impossible to
deal with a so-called "axiomatic" question
which instantly passes into a cloudy rhetorical
illustration.</p>

<p>"The attached servants of a particular
State." Does that expression mean, "England,
with all thy faults, I love thee still"? or, is
it used in the same sense as "attached to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
the staff"? But are there many of the
clergy who would say, "I am an attached and
salaried servant of the State, and nothing
more?" Are there many who would allow
that they were "salaried" by the State at all?
Are there many who would grant that they
had been "examined" and "numbered" and
admitted into a "body of trustworthy persons"
either by the State or by its agents? And
yet all these previous questions must be
answered before we can consider at all the
"axiomatic" question which the clergy are
"earnestly called upon" to solve. The question
set down for solution implies some such
inquiries as these: Is not the Church of
England merely a Department of the State
of England? Does not a clergyman belong
to the Ecclesiastical Service just as an <i>employé</i>
of the Treasury, or the Home Office, or the
Post Office, belongs to the Civil Service?
For example, the authorities at Chamouni
examine and approve of certain men as guides
for mountaineering: does not the English
State similarly examine and approve of certain
men as guides for England and the
English "in the way known of all good men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
that leadeth unto life"? A most fallacious
employment of a "universal" for a "particular,"
for either the clergy must be excluded
from the number of "all good men,"
or the assertion that all good men agree in
their knowledge falls to the ground, seeing
that in the <a href="#IV">fourth Letter</a> the clergy are
charged with not having "determined quite
clearly" what the way that leadeth unto
life may be.</p>

<p>But taking this Alpine illustration for what
it may be worth, we may ask, "What does
it mean?" Is it not intended to exalt
practical questions, and to depreciate all
doctrine and dogma and theological opinion,
either from its liability on the one hand to
be narrow or insular, "Chamounist or Grindelwaldist,"
or on the other from its tendency
to be vague and transcendental, dealing
with "celestial mountains" and unfathomable
"crevasses"? Will it not admit of
some such paraphrase as this, "Your teachings
as to Episcopacy or Congregationalism,
seven sacraments or two, and the like, are
mere local opinions, and so away with them;
your doctrines as to the Holy Trinity, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
Incarnation, and the like, are mere transcendentalism,
and so away with them also,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'For modes of faith let zealous bigots fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He can't be wrong whose life is in the right.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Still it may be allowable to hint that the
qualifications of a "guide" as laid down in
this Letter are somewhat peculiar. It might
have been supposed by a plain man that a
Chamounist guide was expected to know at
least something as to the localities of the
Mer de Glace, the Jardin, or the Grand
Mulets, but he is seemingly to rise superior
to any "Chamounist opinions on geography,"
and to be prepared to rely only upon a universal
science of locality and athletics, a
reliance which has been the fruitful cause
of mountaineering fatalities.</p>

<p>The reply which most Clerical Councils
would return respecting the "axiomatic"
question of this Letter would probably be,
"We cannot answer a fallacy; we are not
careful to answer thee in this matter."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span></p>


<div class="smcapcent"><a href="#III">Letter III</a></div>

<p>A second question is now propounded respecting
the Christian Gospel. "The Gospel
of Christ" is spoken of in a connection
which seems to indicate that Luther and
Augustine were equally, in the writer's
opinion, the setters forth of a "gospel."
Is this an unintentional disclosure of his
estimate of our blessed Lord,&mdash;"Rabbi, we
know that Thou art a teacher come from
God," and no more than that? For <a href="#VIII">the
eighth Letter</a> contains a sneer at the Gospel
that He is our Advocate with the Father,
as one to mend the world with. A confused
question follows, which may mean either,
that it is in the first place desirable that
the Gospel should be put into plain words,
or, that the first principles of the Gospel
should be put into plain words. Its probable
meaning is, "Is it not desirable that
religious teaching should be divested of any
mysteries?" The extraordinary supposition
that the Gospel is intended to be set forth
in the Thirty-nine Articles can only be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
equalled by a supposition that a treatise on
military tactics is embodied in the Articles
of War. Perhaps even some of the axiomatic
principles of mathematics, such as that
"a point is that which hath no parts," though
laid down in "plain words and short terms,"
might sorely perplex "simple persons."</p>

<p>But several fallacies underlie this second
question. The fallacy that the moral principles
of our nature are necessarily connected
with the extent of our intellectual capacities;
the fallacy that Divine Truths can be adequately
expressed through the inaccurate instrument
of human language; the fallacy that
deep things are necessarily made plain by the
use of plain words; the fallacy that everything
upon which we act is necessarily understood.
A plain man does not refuse to use the telegraph
because he may know nothing about
the Correlation of Force, or a simple person
to travel because "space" is beyond his comprehension.
If the Gospel is, as St. Paul
says it is, a revelation of the power of God
unto salvation, an amount of mystery must
necessarily surround it. Since it is impossible
that the Divine Nature should be to us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
other than a mystery, a revelation of Divine
purposes such as is the Gospel as understood
by the Church, must remain mysterious also.
Only upon the supposition that our Lord was
the teacher of a high but still human morality
can we remove all mystery from the Christian
Gospel, if it still deserve the name. Such
teaching might be conveyed in plain words
and short terms, but it would cease to be a
Gospel which angels desire to look into, and
could hardly be described as the "manifold
wisdom of God," or be the story of the "love
of Christ, which passeth knowledge."</p>

<p>The Gospel, as the Church understands it,
rests upon the revealed fact of the Incarnation,
or the union of the Infinite with the
Finite, that He who is very God of very God
became man in order to introduce the Divine
possibility of manhood being made to partake
of the Divine nature; and so long as the
triumphal chant ascends that "the Catholic
Faith is this," so long will the Church's Faith
be veiled indeed with mystery, and so long
will she continue to gather within her bounds
the humble and holy men of heart, who are
content to say, "I cannot understand: I love."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
That "God sent His only-begotten Son into
the world that we might live through Him"
are short and plain words enough, and Gospel
enough, surely, but the depth of their meaning
is unfathomable by even the most cultivated
understanding, to which the power of
God and the wisdom of God may appear to
be but foolishness.</p>


<div class="smcapcent"><a href="#IX">Letter IX</a></div>

<p>This Letter, after endorsing the expressions
of the preceding one, deals apparently with
Capital and Labour. The clergy, if not required
to divide the inheritance among their
brethren, or to actually serve tables, are, taking
"Property is theft" as their text, to resolutely
and daily inquire how the dinners of their
flock are earned. The gist of the Letter seems
to be that the worker earns and the capitalist
steals his dinner. It is really possible that
the clergy do constantly speak the truth,
boldly rebuke vice, and patiently suffer for the
truth's sake, even though they may not subscribe
to all the articles of some peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
schemes of social science, nor hold some
singular doctrines as to political economy.
Doubtless were they to assimilate their conduct
to that of an injudicious district-visitor,
they would have to take a new view of "life
and its sacraments," whatever this expression
may mean.</p>

<p>It would seem as if the writer had yet to
learn that a Christian Church may exist teaching
the most dogmatic definitions of doctrine,
binding, even in this respect, burdens on
men's shoulders grievous to be borne, while
its members may be patterns of self-denial in
"offices of temporal ministry to the poor."
He does not appear to regard with favour the
"Evangelistic sect of the English Church;" if
this is intended for the "Evangelical" sect,
Charles Kingsley could say, in a certain place,
of its founders, "They were inspired by a
strange new instinct that God had bidden
them 'to clothe the hungry and feed the
naked.'" Yet these men thought that "justification
by faith only" was the Gospel they
were "to carry to mend the world with,
forsooth."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span></p>


<div class="smcapcent"><a href="#XI">Letter XI</a></div>

<p>This concluding Letter calls but for slight
remark,&mdash;of many portions we feel <i>O si sic
omnia</i>! That there is much sorrowful truth
underlying the unmeasured denunciations
which have gone before few will care to deny.
Few there are who will not pray to be kept
from the evils which the writer discerns, and
against which he inveighs. Such will be the
first to regret that the Letters, as they read
them, seem to fall short of the fulness of the
Catholic Faith. "The holy teachers of all
nations:" was our blessed Lord but one of
them? There is nothing in the Letters to
show that "the full force and meaning" of
Gospel teaching is concerned with anything
beyond wealth, and comfort, and national prosperity,
and domestic peace. Preaching the
acceptable year of the Lord is something more
surely than an invective against usury.</p>

<p>We read that in old times Bezaleel was
filled for his own work with the Spirit of God,
but we do not read that he aspired to become
a religious teacher; and when we are told by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
one eminent in Art that a Church nineteen
centuries old has yet to learn that the "will
of the Lord" is a sanctification which brings
comfort and wealth in its train, we think of a
Moses who esteemed the reproach of Christ
greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt,
and then of a Paul who counted all things
but loss for the excellency of the knowledge
of Christ Jesus his Lord.</p>

<h4><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Oxoniensis</span>.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Malleson</span>,&mdash;Many thanks for
the pamphlet. You ask me to send you any
remarks I may have to make on the Letters,
and I gather from your note at the beginning
of the Letters as they now stand, that you
intend making use of any remarks sent you
that may commend themselves to your judgment.
I am not vain enough to think mine
of any special value. I will, however, write
you my feelings about them, encouraged to
do so by your statement in the note to the
pamphlet, that the use made of remarks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
sent you will be anonymous, if it is so
desired.</p>

<p>First, as regards the general tone of the
Letters. You tell me that the majority of the
comments you have received have been hostile&mdash;people
not taking their medicine without
making wry faces. I am only surprised at
the gentleness of the Letters, and I believe
that if anyone will take the trouble to put
down for himself on paper the sum of their
contents, he will find it as difficult to gainsay
as for careless readers it is easy to cavil at.
On the other hand, the "hostile spirit" is
readily provoked by the way in which some
of the teaching of the Letters is put. Passages
like the sixth paragraph in <a href="#X">Letter X.</a> appear
an objectionable joke to some&mdash;perhaps to
most&mdash;people; they do not see that it is really
a serious jest, so put for brevity's sake, and
that Ruskin might have put the same note to
it as he has put to a passage in the "Crown
of Wild Olive," p. 85, 8vo ed.: "Quite serious
all this, though it reads like jest." I remember
once asking Ruskin if his apparent joking
in some Oxford lectures was not likely to
lessen his influence, and he at once said to me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
"Remember that most of my apparent jokes
are serious, <i>ghastly</i> jests." I think he would
be less often misunderstood, if this were more
often understood.</p>

<p>Your own preface marks the two main
points in the spirit of the Letters. They
are sternly practical, and at the same time
their standard is one of an ideal perfection.
People don't see that because the
goal cannot be reached, the road towards it
can still be trodden, and therefore they
apply to the road an epithet which applies
only to the goal. In this respect Ruskin's
teaching might be mottoed with George
Herbert's&mdash;</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"Who aimeth at the sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shoots higher much than he that means a tree."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>In fact, Ruskin's teaching, like that of the
Bible, is not unpractical, but <i>unpractised</i>.</p>

<p>I will now take the Letters in detail. The
first four of them are merely introductory to
the main matter of the eleven. In these first
five two questions are asked&mdash;</p>

<p>1. What is a clergyman of the Church of
England? And to this the suggested answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
is (whom does it offend?), "A teacher of the
Gospel of Christ to all nations."</p>

<p>2. What is the teaching of the Gospel he is
to teach? What is that teaching, clearly and
simply put?</p>

<p>Then <a href="#IV">Letter IV.</a> suggests that the Lord's
Prayer may be taken as containing the cardinal
points of that teaching, containing not all
that is to be learnt, but what all have to learn.
And so we come to <a href="#V">Letter V.</a>; and I tried, in
reading the Letters for myself, to do for them
what <a href="#III">Letter III.</a> asks clergymen to do for the
Gospel.</p>

<p><a href="#V">Letter V.</a>&mdash;A clergyman's first duty is to
make the Lord's Prayer clear and living to his
people. This is what Ruskin has elsewhere
insisted on in other matters&mdash;"clear," know
your duty and your belief; "living," realize it
in your life&mdash;realize it "as a Captain's order,
to be obeyed" ("Crown of Wild Olive," Introduction,
p. 13. The whole of this Introduction
reads well with these Letters). Then the first
clause of the Prayer is set forth as putting
before us God as a loving Father.</p>

<p><a href="#VI">Letter VI.</a>&mdash;"Hallowed be Thy name." How
do we fulfil the hope in our lives? How do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
we betray it? Not in swearing only, as we
are apt to think, but in the blasphemy of false
and hypocritical prayer to, and praise of,
<i>preaching about</i> God (last paragraph of the
Letter). Clergymen, it is added, can prevent
openly wicked men from being in their congregations
(they are supposed to do so: Rubrics
2 and 3 before the Holy Communion Service);
they can not only compel the wicked poor into,
but expel the wicked rich out of, churches.
God sees the heart: the clergy should look to
the hands and lips.</p>

<p><a href="#VII">Letter VII.</a>&mdash;"Thy kingdom come:"&mdash;not
an allusion to the second coming of the Son,
which we cannot hasten, but to the coming of
the kingdom of God the Father, which we
can. This is again illustrated by the "Crown
of Wild Olive" (I daresay it is by others of
Ruskin's books, but it is convenient to refer
chiefly to one, and that the one which contains
what he calls his most biblical lecture), p. 56:
"Observe it is a kingdom that is to come to
us; we are not to go to it. Also it is not to
be a kingdom of the dead, but of the living.
Also it is not to come all at once, but quietly
... without observation.  <i>Also it is not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
come outside of us, but in our hearts: 'the
kingdom of God is within you.'</i>" This is
the sense in which we can hasten <i>it</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#VIII">Letter VIII.</a> begins with a hit at the pleasure
priests take in their priesthood's dignity,
and at their avoidance of its unpleasant
duties, and at their sometimes wearisome
preaching.</p>

<p>Have they ever taught "Thy will be done,"
as it should be&mdash;1. In our own sanctification;
2. In understanding that will, and doing it,
and striving to get it done (knowing their duty
and doing it, and it alone)?</p>

<p>The remarks about the mediatorial (absolving-from-punishment)
and the pastoral (purging-from-sin)
functions of a "pastor," seem
to me quite admirable.</p>

<p>The end of the Letter is subsequently amplified,
<a href="#X">Letter X.</a></p>

<p><a href="#IX">Letter IX.</a>&mdash;"Give us this day our daily
bread." Yes, but we must work for it. "The
man that will not work, neither shall he eat."
A cardinal point with Ruskin: "But if you
do" (<i>i.e.</i>, wish for God's kingdom), "you must
do more than pray for it, you must work for
it" ("Crown of Wild Olive," p. 56).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span></p>

<p>And the clergyman has to teach (<a href="#IX">Letter IX.</a>
goes on) what that work is and how it is to
be done; and the life, to which their teaching
should lead, is one "moderate in its self-indulgence,
wide in its offices of temporal ministry
to the poor," in the absence of which, prayer
for harvest is mere blasphemy. For the spiritual
bread is the first thing, and a clergyman's
first message, "Choose ye this day
whom ye will serve."</p>

<p><a href="#X">Letter X.</a>&mdash;"Forgive us our trespasses."
The explanation of trespasses, and substitution
of <i>debts</i> for it, is admirable ("Dimitte
nobis <i>debita</i> nostra"), and admirably illustrated
by the sins of omission being condemned in
Christ's judgment,&mdash;"I was hungry, and ye
gave Me no meat."</p>

<p>The remarks on the "pleasantness" of the
English liturgy recall those on the avoidance
of unpleasantness by the English clergy in
<a href="#VIII">Letter VIII.</a></p>

<p>I pass over the notes on the advantage
of "forms of prayer," and come to the end
of Letter <a href="#X">X.</a> and Letter <a href="#XI">XI.</a>, which go together,
and say practically, Pray honestly or
not at all. "Faithful prayer implies always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
correlative exertions;" "dishonest prayer is
blasphemy of the worst kind."</p>

<p>"Crown of Wild Olive," p. 55, again:
"Everybody in this room has been taught to
pray daily, 'Thy kingdom come.' Now, if we
hear a man swear in the streets, we think it
very wrong, and say he 'takes God's name
in vain.' But there is a twenty times worse
way of taking His name in vain than that.
It is to <i>ask God for what we don't want</i>.
He doesn't like that sort of prayer. If you
don't want a thing, don't ask for it; such
asking is the worst mockery of your King
you can insult Him with; the soldiers striking
Him on the head was nothing to that. If
you do not wish for His kingdom, don't pray
for it."</p>

<p>In fact, prayer is worse than useless if not
sincere, and it is insincere if not carried out
in the life of the "pray-er." Thus, "One
hour in the execution of justice is worth
seventy years of (insincere) prayer" (Mahometan
maxim, "Crown of Wild Olive,"
p. 49).</p>

<p>I must stop. Only the fifth paragraph
in <a href="#XI">Letter XI.</a>, about parents looking for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
"opportunities" for their children, is exactly
parallel with "Sesame and Lilies," 8vo edition,
p. 2 (Sub. 1, § 2), which might be added in
an illustrative note. I must apologize for my
long and rambling letter, but if it is of the
least service to you I shall be content. I feel
how inadequate it is to what I meant it to
be, only I have no time just now to do more
than write, as this letter is written&mdash;at the
point of the pen.</p>

<h3><a name="PREFACE_2" id="PREFACE_2"></a>PREFACE</h3>

<p>Some apology will naturally be expected
for setting the following letters before
the searching eye of a critical and possibly
censorious public. I can only
plead that the suggestion of their publication
did not emanate from myself
(for the idea of making these letters
public property had never once in fifteen
years crossed my mind), but was made
to me by friends to whom it appeared
that much in these letters is strongly
characteristic of Mr. Ruskin, and illustrates
(much too indulgently, alas!)
the estimate he is good enough to form
of a correspondent who does not to this
day clearly understand to what happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
circumstance he is indebted for so fortunate
a partiality. At the same time it
must be confessed that <i>Laudari a viro
laudato</i> is a harmless ambition for the
possession of a stimulus which is good
for every soul of man.</p>

<p>I will say no more upon that subject,
lest my self-depreciation should be
set down to vanity. Nevertheless it has
always been a source of innocent pleasure
to me that I have been enabled to
bring my ship without damage through
so perilous a voyage to port in a safe
and honourable harbourage.</p>

<p>The matters discussed in the following
letters range only over a narrow field;
but it will be found that they present a
truly life-like picture of the writer with
his shrewd common-sense and deeper
wisdom, enlivened in no small measure
by a quick impulsiveness which is sometimes
rather startling.  Some of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
sudden sallies serve the purpose of the
condiments, which displeasing if taken
alone, give piquancy to our ordinary
food.</p>

make no public announcement of any

ways of it. I hope to have you for a

<p>Thanks for your note and your kind
feelings. But you ought to know more
about me.</p>

<p>I profess to be a teacher; as you profess
also.</p>

<p>But we teach on totally different
methods.</p>

<p><i>You</i> believe what you wish to believe;
teach that it is wicked to doubt
it, and remain at rest and in much
self-satisfaction.</p>

<p><i>I</i> believe what I find to be true,
whether I like or dislike it. And I
teach other people that the chief of all
wickednesses is to tell lies in God's
service, and to disgrace our Master
and destroy His sheep as <i>involuntary</i>
Wolves.</p>

<p><i>I</i>, therefore, am in perpetual effort to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
learn and discern&mdash;in perpetual Unrest
and Dissatisfaction with myself.</p>

<p>But it would simply require you to
do twenty years of such hard work as
I have done before you could in any
true sense speak a word to me on
such matters. You could not use a
word in my sense. It would always
mean to you something different.</p>

<p>For instance&mdash;one of my quite bye
works in learning my business of a
teacher&mdash;was to read the New Testament
through in the earliest Greek MS.
(eleventh century) which I could get
hold of. I examined every syllable of
it and have more notes of various readings
and on the real meanings of perverted
passages than you would get
through in a year's work. But I should
require you to do the same work before
I would discuss a text with you. From
that and such work in all kinds I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
formed opinions which you could no
more move than you could Coniston
Old Man. They may be wrong, God
knows; I <i>trust</i> in them infinitely less
than you do in those which you have
formed simply by refusing to examine&mdash;or
to think&mdash;or to know what is doing
in the world about you; but you cannot
stir them.</p>

<p>I very very rarely make presents of my
books. If people are inclined to learn
from them, I say to them as a physician
would&mdash;Pay me my fee&mdash;you will not
obey me if I give you advice for nothing.</p>

<p>But I should like a kind neighbour like
you to know something about me, and I
have therefore desired my publisher to
send you one<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> of my many books which,
after doing the work that I have done,
you would have to read before you could
really use words in my meaning.</p>


<p>If you will read the introduction carefully,
and especially dwell on the 10th
to 15th lines of the 15th page, you will
at least know me a little better than to
think I believe in my own resurrection&mdash;but
not in Christ's: and if you
look to the final essay on War, you
may find some things in it which will
be of interest to you in your own<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>

have done more if you had written the
lives of two or three of your parishioners.
Such an answer would I give
to a painter who sent to me a picture
of the Last Supper. "You had better,
it seems to me, have painted a Harvest
Home." I am gravely doubtful of the
possibility, in these days, of writing or
painting on such subjects, advisedly and
securely.</p>

<p>I have received this week the two
most astonishing letters I ever yet
received in my life. And one of them
is yours, read this morning&mdash;telling
me&mdash;that you don't think you could
write the life of an old woman! Yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
you think you <i>can</i> write the life of
Christ!</p>

<p>If you can at all explain this state of
your mind to me I will tell you more
distinctly what I think of the piece I
saw. But I don't think you will communicate
the thought to your publisher;
and I never meant you to use
my former one in that manner.</p>

<p>Mind a publisher thinks only of
money, and I know nothing of saleableness.
The pause in my other letters
is one of pure astonishment at you;
which at present occupies all the time
I have to spare on the subject, and has
culminated to-day.</p>

<p>I am so puzzled. I can scarcely
think of anything else till you tell me
what you mean in the bit about being
"called late."</p>

'yet' then?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span></p>

<p>I am still simply speechless with
astonishment at you. It is no question

is all at your command. But for the

<p>It is just because you undertook the
task so <i>happily</i>, that I should have
thought you unfit to write the life of
a Man of Sorrows, even had he been
a Man only. But your last letter,
remember, claims inspiration for your
guide, and recognizes a personal call at
sixty, as if the Call to the ministry
had been none, and the receiving the
Holy Ghost by imposition of hands an
empty ceremony.</p>

<p>In writing the life of a parishioner
and in remitting or retaining their sins
you would in my conception have been
fulfilling your appointed work. But
I cannot conceive the claim to be a
fit Evangelist without more proof of
miraculous appointment than you are
conscious of.  I know you to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
conscientious, yes&mdash;but I think the
judicial doom of this country is to have
conscience alike of its Priests and Prophets
<i>hardened</i>. Why should any letter
of mine make you anxious if you had
indeed conscience of inspiration?</p>

there is no need whatever of more than
three or four more respecting the last
clauses of the Lord's Prayer. Those in
your hands contain questions enough, if
seriously entertained, to occupy twenty
meetings; and I could only hope that
some one of them might be carefully
taken up by your friends.  I think,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
however, in case of the clerical feeling
being too strong, that I must ask you,
if you print letters at all, to print them
without omission. And if you do not
print them, to return them to me for
my own expansion and arrangement.</p>

<p>That there are only a hundred copies

the advantages of a small house (and
it has many) that one is compelled to

only send them in case you want to
look at the challenge referred to in the
Letters to the Bishop of Manchester,
see October, 1877, pp. 322, 323, and
January 1875, p. 11. You can keep as

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Ruskin</span>,&mdash;These parish
engagements having been discharged
which have taken up my time very
closely since I came back from Brighton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
I am returning to your letters, and I
think you would like to know what
I am doing. I am copying them down,
first, as I can read them aloud better
in my own handwriting, and secondly,
because I shall not place the originals
in the printer's hands.</p>

<p>Then many thoughts arise in my
mind as I re-peruse them, and I must
needs (and I think I am allowed) give
expression to my thoughts. Hence each
letter is followed by my own comments
or reflections upon it. But this need
not make you feel nervous. On the
whole there is much agreement between
your modes of thought on religious subjects
and my own.</p>

<p>If this is thought a piece of cool
assurance, I may reply in the words
or sense of Euclid, That similar triangles
may have the most various areas. I
am not equal to you, but I claim to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
similar. These comments I sometimes
think I ought to show to you before publication;
but perhaps you will agree with
me that if I am fit to be trusted at all,
I had better be left unconstrained. I
shall certainly come to you first, if I find
myself seriously at variance with you,
which has not happened yet as far as the
first clause of the Lord's Prayer. Then
it is likely that I shall read the letters
before two or three Clerical Societies,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
including my own, the Furness.</p>


<p>The opinions delivered by those
clergy it will be my duty, and I hope
it will be my pleasure, to collect and
to record. I propose also to invite
the clergy who have not time or opportunity
to speak in the meeting to write
to me, and I will use my best judgment
in selecting from their correspondence
all that seems worth preserving.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span></p>

<p>I am very sensible that this is a
most delicate and responsible task that
is laid upon me, and I wonder to find
myself so engaged. It will need tact,
discretion, and kindness of heart, and I
trust I may be endued with the necessary
qualifications to a much larger extent
than I think I naturally possess.</p>

<p>I find no small comfort at the foot of
the first page of the Preface to "Sesame
and Lilies." There I feel I am at one
with you.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no debate possible
as to what usury is any more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
what adultery is. The Church has only

since the 16th century. Usury is <i>any

it is the essential modern form of
Satan.</p>

<div class="right">

Broughton-in-Furness,</span><br />
<i>September 12th</i>, 1879.
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Ruskin</span>,&mdash;I feel in a
great strait. I have before me a task of
the utmost delicacy, and one before which
I feel that I <i>ought</i> to shrink,&mdash;that of
editing your letters, with the accompaniment
of comments of my own. You
trust me, evidently, or you would have
laid down limitations to guard yourself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
against misrepresentation. My anxiety
is lest I should abuse that large and
generous confidence you have so kindly
placed in me. Let me explain my position,
as I see it myself.</p>

<p>The series will consist of eleven
letters, when you have sent me your
last. I have now copied nine, and
written concisely the views I have
presumed to form upon each. With
every letter I mostly agree and sympathize,
looking on them as "counsels
of perfection," and viewing the great
subjects you deal with from a far
higher standpoint than (in my experience)
either laymen or clergymen
generally view them. All that there
is in me of <i>enthusiasm</i> rings in answering
chords to the notes you
strike. Yet I do not <i>always</i> agree.
But when I do disagree, I acknowledge
it is because your standard is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
excessively high&mdash;too high for practical
purposes.</p>

<p>Now, I ask, shall you consider it
strictly fair and honourable in me to
receive your letters, read them or
send them to assemblies of clergy,
gather their views, both adverse and
favourable, and add diffident animad-versions
of my own? If you will allow
this to be right, and if you will trust
to my sense of what is proper, to
deal with your letters in the spirit of
a Christian and a gentleman, then,
hoping to fulfil your expectations, I
shall proceed in my work with a
mind more at ease; for I could not
endure the thought that, after all was
done, I had written a single sentence
or word that had inflicted pain upon
you.</p>

<p>Then comes another question. Do
you wish to hear or read my comments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
before they are printed? I say frankly,
if you trust me, I would prefer not;
for it would not, perhaps, be pleasant
for me either to read your praises, or
my poor criticisms, to your face. But
still, if you wish it, I shall be ready
at your bidding; for I recognize your
right to require it. Only I would
rather read them to you myself some
quiet autumn evening or two.</p>

should like to read the sheets as they
are issued, and put merely letters of
reference, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i>, to be taken up in
a short epilogue. But I don't want to
do or say anything till you have all

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Malleson</span>,&mdash;My sister has
asked me to write and thank you for
two copies of Mr. Ruskin's Letters,
which you have been so good as
to send to her. It is curious that
before the post came this morning I
had been wondering whether I might
ask you for a copy. * * * I have
already read these deeply interesting
Letters five times. They are like the
"foam globes of leaven," I might say
they have exercised my mind very
much. Things in them which at first
seemed rather startling, prove on closer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
examination to be full of deep truth.
The suggestions in them lead to "great
searchings of heart." There is much
with which I entirely agree; much
over which to ponder. What an insight
into human nature is shown
in the remark that though we are
so ready to call ourselves "miserable
sinners," we resent being accused of
any special fault. * * *</p>

<p>I am so glad we understand each
other now and that you will carry out
your plan quietly.</p>

<p>I think you should correct the present
little book by my revise, and print
enough for whatever private circulation
the members of the meeting wish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>

till well after the large book is out.

you never remember that it

I think it needs very considerable

that had there been in all these letters
any which conveyed censure, stricture,

have withheld my hand from including
them. But no such letters ever came
to me. Mr. Ruskin is the very pink

I see there's a letter from you which I

as it is coming out I believe it will be
a useful contribution to the book.</p>

You will find the Litany following
the Quicunque vult, and on the leaf
marked by me 83, at the top the passage
I began quotation with. It will
need a note; for <i>domptnum</i> is, I believe,
strong Yorkshire Latin for Donum
Apostolicum, not Dominum.</p>

<p>The <i>e</i> in Ecclesie for <i>æ</i> is the proper

the coloured print Prayer-Book as I

of the way Romanism had
ruined itself at that date. But it may
contain in legible form some things
of interest. I never could make out
so much as its Calendar; but the songs
about the saints and rhymed hours
are very pretty. Though the illuminations
are all ridiculous and one or
two frightful, most are more or less

The Drum of that Diana Temple is

<p>I'm not in the least anxious about
my MS., and shall only be glad if you
like to keep it long enough to read
thoroughly. There must surely be published
copies of such extant, though,
and worth enquiring after?</p>

<p>Partly the fine weather, partly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>

have stopped the Epilogue utterly for

<p>I don't think you will find the n's and
m's much bother; the contractions are
the great nuisance. But I do think this
development of Gothic writing one of
the oddest absurdities of mankind.</p>

<p>The illumination of "the fool hath
said in his heart," snapping his fingers,
or more accurately making the indecent
sign called "the fig" by the Italians,
is a very unusual one in this MS., and
peculiarly English.</p>

and what I do know is out of and in

it without trouble.</p>

<p>For the rest you must please always
remember what I told you once for all,
that you could never interest <i>me</i> by
writing about people, either at Athens
or Ephesus, but only of those of the

<p>That new translation could not come
out well; that much I know without

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Brantwood, Coniston</span>, <i>June 1880</i>.
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Malleson</span>,&mdash;I have glanced
at the proofs you send; and <i>can</i> do no
more than glance, even if it seemed to
me desirable that I should do more,&mdash;which,
after said glance, it does in no
wise. Let me remind you of what it
is absolutely necessary that the readers
of the book should clearly understand&mdash;that
I wrote these Letters at your
request, to be read and discussed at the
meeting of a private society of clergymen.
I declined then to be present at
the discussion, and I decline still. You
afterwards asked leave to print the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
Letters, to which I replied that they
were yours, for whatever use you saw
good to make of them: afterwards
your plans expanded, while my own
notion remained precisely what it had
been&mdash;that the discussion should have
been private, and kept within the
limits of the society, and that its
conclusions, if any, should have been
announced in a few pages of clear
print, for the parishioners' exclusive
reading.</p>

<p>I am, of course, flattered by the wider
course you have obtained for the Letters,
but am not in the slightest degree interested
by the debate upon them, nor by
any religious debates whatever, undertaken
without serious conviction that
there is a jot wrong in matters as they
are, or serious resolution to make them
a tittle better. Which, so far as I can
read the minds of your correspondents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
appears to me the substantial state of
them.</p>

<p>One thing I cannot pass without protest&mdash;the
quantity of talk about the
writer of the Letters. What I am, or
am not, is of no moment whatever to
the matters in hand. I observe with
comfort, or at least with complacency,
that on the strength of a couple of
hours' talk, at a time when I was
thinking chiefly of the weatherings of
slate you were good enough to show
me above Goat's Water, you would
have ventured to baptize me in the
little lake&mdash;as not a goat, but a sheep.
The best I can be sure of, myself, is
that I am no wolf, and have never
aspired to the dignity even of a Dog
of the Lord.</p>

<p>You told me, if I remember rightly,
that one of the members of the original
meeting denounced me as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
arch-heretic<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>&mdash;meaning, doubtless, an
arch-pagan; for a heretic, or sect-maker,
is of all terms of reproach the last
that can be used of me. And I think he
should have been answered that it was
precisely as an arch-pagan that I ventured
to request a more intelligible and
more unanimous account of the Christian
Gospel from its preachers.</p>

<p>If anything in the Letters offended
those of you who hold me a brother,
surely it had been best to tell me
between ourselves, or to tell it to the
Church, or to let me be Anathema
Maranatha in peace,&mdash;in any case, I
must at present so abide, correcting
only the mistakes about myself which
have led to graver ones about the things
I wanted to speak of.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span></p>
<p>The most singular one, perhaps, in
all the Letters is that of Mr. &mdash;&mdash;,
that I do not attach enough weight to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
antiquity. My reply to it is partly
written already, with reference to the
wishes of some other of your correspondents
to know more of my reasons
for finding fault with the English
Liturgy.</p>

<p>If people are taught to use the
Liturgy rightly and reverently, it will
bring them all good; and for some
thirty years of my life I used to read
it always through to my servant and
myself, if we had no Protestant church
to go to, in Alpine or Italian villages.
One can always tacitly pray of it
what one wants, and let the rest pass.
But, as I have grown older, and
watched the decline in the Christian
faith of all nations, I have got more
and more suspicious of the effect of
this particular form of words on the
truthfulness of the English mind (now
fast becoming a salt which has lost his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
savour, and is fit only to be trodden
under foot of men). And during the
last ten years, in which my position at
Oxford has compelled me to examine
what authority there was for the code
of prayer, of which the University is now
so ashamed that it no more dares compel
its youths so much as to hear, much
less to utter it, I got necessarily into
the habit of always looking to the
original forms of the prayers of the fully
developed Christian Church. Nor did I
think it a mere chance which placed in
my own possession a manuscript of the
perfect Church service of the thirteenth
century,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> written by the monks of the
Sainte Chapelle for St. Louis; together
with one of the same date, written in
England, probably for the Diocese of
Lincoln; adding some of the Collects,
in which it corresponds with St. Louis's,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
and the Latin hymns so much beloved
by Dante, with the appointed music for
them.</p>


<p>And my wonder has been greater
every hour, since I examined closely
the text of these and other early books,
that in any state of declining, or captive,
energy, the Church of England should
have contented itself with a service
which cast out, from beginning to end,
all these intensely spiritual and passionate
utterances of chanted prayer
(the whole body, that is to say, of
the authentic <i>Christian</i> Psalms), and in
adopting what it timidly preserved of
the Collects, mangled or blunted them
down to the exact degree which would
make them either unintelligible or inoffensive&mdash;so
vague that everybody
might use them, or so pointless that
nobody could be offended by them.
For a special instance: The prayer for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
"our bishops and curates, and all congregations
committed to their charge,"
is, in the Lincoln Service-book, "for
our bishop, and all congregations committed
to <i>his</i> charge." The change from
singular to plural seems a slight one.
But it suffices to take the eyes of the
people off their own bishop into infinite
space; to change a prayer which was intended
to be uttered in personal anxiety
and affection, into one for the general
good of the Church, of which nobody
could judge, and for which nobody would
particularly care; and, finally, to change
a prayer to which the answer, if given,
would be visible, into one of which nobody
could tell whether it were answered
or not.</p>

<p>In the Collects, the change, though
verbally slight, is thus tremendous in
issue. But in the Litany&mdash;word and
thought go all wild together.  The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
first prayer of the Litany in the Lincoln
Service-book is for the Pope and all
ranks beneath him, implying a very
noteworthy piece of theology&mdash;that the
Pope might err in religious matters,
and that the prayer of the humblest
servant of God would be useful to
him:&mdash;"Ut Dompnum Apostolicum, et
omnes gradus ecclesie in sancta religione
conservare digneris." Meaning
that whatever errors particular persons
might, and must, fall into, they prayed
God to keep the Pope right, and the
collective testimony and conduct of
the ranks below him. Then follows
the prayer for their own bishop and
<i>his</i> flock&mdash;then for the king and the
princes (chief lords), that they (not
all nations) might be kept in concord&mdash;and
then for <i>our</i> bishops and
abbots,&mdash;the Church of England proper;
every one of these petitions being direct,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
limited, and personally heartfelt;&mdash;and
then this lovely one for themselves:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ut obsequium servitutis nostre rationabile
facias."&mdash;"That thou wouldst
make the obedience of our service
reasonable" ("which is your reasonable
service").<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>


<p>This glorious prayer is, I believe,
accurately an "early English" one. It
is not in the St. Louis Litany, nor
in a later elaborate French fourteenth
century one; but I find it softened in
an Italian MS. of the fifteenth century
into "ut nosmet ipsos in tuo sancto
servitio confortare et conservare digneris,"&mdash;"that
thou wouldst deign to
keep and comfort us ourselves in thy
sacred service" (the comfort, observe,
being here asked for whether reasonable
or not!); and in the best and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
fullest French service-book I have,
printed at Rouen in 1520, it becomes,
"ut congregationes omnium sanctorum
in tuo sancto servitio conservare digneris;"
while victory as well as concord
is asked for the king and the
princes,&mdash;thus leading the way to that
for our own Queen's victory over all her
enemies, a prayer which might now be
advisedly altered into one that she&mdash;and
in her, the monarchy of England&mdash;might
find more fidelity in their
friends.</p>

<p>I give one more example of the corruption
of our Prayer-Book, with reference
to the objections taken by some of
your correspondents to the distinction
implied in my Letters between the Persons
of the Father and the Christ.</p>

<p>The "Memoria de Sancta Trinitate,"
in the St. Louis service-book, runs thus:</p>

<p>"Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, qui<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
dedisti famulis tuis in confessione vere
fidei eterne Trinitatis gloriam agnoscere,
et in potentia majestatis adorare
unitatem, quesumus ut ejus fidei firmitate
ab omnibus semper muniemur adversis.
Qui vivis et regnas Deus, per
omnia secula seculorum. Amen."</p>

<p>"Almighty and everlasting God, who
hast given to Thy servants, in confession
of true faith to recognize the
glory of the Eternal Trinity, and in
the power of Majesty to pray to the
Unity; we ask that by the firmness of
that faith we may be always defended
from all adverse things, who livest and
reignest God through all ages. Amen."</p>

<p>Turning to our Collect, we find we
have first slipped in the word "us"
before "Thy servants," and by that
little insertion have slipped in the squire
and his jockey, and the public-house
landlord&mdash;and any one else who may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
chance to have been coaxed, swept,
or threatened into church on Trinity
Sunday, and required the entire company
of them to profess themselves
servants of God, and believers in the
mystery of the Trinity. And we think
we have done God a service!</p>

<p>"Grace." Not a word about grace
in the original. You don't believe by
having grace, but by having wit.</p>

<p>"To acknowledge." "Agnosco" is
to recognize, not to acknowledge. To
<i>see</i> that there are three lights in a
chandelier is a great deal more than
to acknowledge that they are there.</p>

<p>"To worship." "Adorare" is to
pray to, not to worship. You may worship
a mere magistrate; but you <i>pray</i>
to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>The last sentence in the English is
too horribly mutilated to be dealt with
in any patience. The meaning of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
great old collect is that by the shield
of that faith we may quench all the
fiery darts of the devil. The English
prayer means, if it means anything,
"Please keep us in our faith without
our taking any trouble; and, besides,
please don't let us lose our money, nor
catch cold."</p>

<p>"Who livest and reignest." Right;
but how many of any extant or instant
congregations understand what the two
words mean? That God is a living
God, not a dead Law; and that He is
a reigning God, putting wrong things
to rights, and that, sooner or later, with
a strong hand and a rod of iron; and
not at all with a soft sponge and warm
water, washing everybody as clean as
a baby every Sunday morning, whatever
dirty work they may have been
about all the week.</p>

<p>On which latter supposition your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
modern Liturgy, in so far as it has supplemented
instead of corrected the old
one, has entirely modelled itself,&mdash;producing
in its first address to the congregation
before the Almighty precisely
the faultfullest and foolishest piece of
English language that I know in the
whole compass of English or American
literature. In the seventeen lines of it
(as printed in my old-fashioned, large-print
prayer-book), there are seven times
over two words for one idea.</p>

<div class="list">
1. Acknowledge and confess.<br />
2. Sins and wickedness.<br />
3. Dissemble nor cloke.<br />
4. Goodness and mercy.<br />
5. Assemble and meet.<br />
6. Requisite and necessary.<br />
7. Pray and beseech.<br />
</div>

<p>There is, indeed, a shade of difference
in some of these ideas for a good scholar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
none for a general congregation;<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and
what difference they can guess at merely
muddles their heads: to acknowledge
sin is indeed different from confessing
it, but it cannot be done at a minute's
notice; and goodness is a different thing
from mercy, but it is by no means
God's infinite goodness that forgives
our badness, but that judges it.</p>


<p>"The faultfullest," I said, "and the
foolishest." After using fourteen words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
where seven would have done, what is
it that the whole speech gets said with
its much speaking? This Morning
Service of all England begins with the
assertion that the Scripture moveth us
in sundry places to confess our sins
before God. <i>Does</i> it so? Have your
congregations ever been referred to those
sundry places? Or do they take the
assertion on trust, or remain under the
impression that, unless with the advantage
of their own candour, God
must remain ill-informed on the subject
of their sins?</p>

<p>"That we should not dissemble nor
cloke them." <i>Can</i> we then? Are
these grown-up congregations of the
enlightened English Church in the
nineteenth century still so young in
their nurseries that the "Thou, God,
seest me" is still not believed by them
if they get under the bed?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span></p>

<p>Let us look up the sundry moving
passages referred to.</p>

<p>(I suppose myself a simple lamb of
the flock, and only able to use my
English Bible.)</p>

<p>I find in my concordance (confess and
confession together) forty-two occurrences
of the word. Sixteen of these,
including John's confession that he was
not the Christ, and the confession of
the faithful fathers that they were pilgrims
on the earth, do indeed move us
strongly to confess Christ before men.
Have you ever taught your congregations
what that confession means?
They are ready enough to confess
Him in church, that is to say, in their
own private synagogue. Will they in
Parliament? Will they in a ball-room?
Will they in a shop? Sixteen of the
texts are to enforce their doing <i>that</i>.</p>

<p>The next most important one (1 Tim.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
vi. 13) refers to Christ's own good
confession, which I suppose was not of
His sins, but of His obedience. How
many of your congregations can make
any such kind of confession, or wish to
make it?</p>

<p>The eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth
(1 Kings viii. 33, 2 Chron. vi. 26,
Heb. xiii. 15) speak of confessing thankfully
that God is God (and not a putrid
plasma nor a theory of development),
and the twenty-first (Job xl. 14) speaks
of God's own confession, that no doubt
we are the people, and that wisdom
shall die with us, and on what conditions
He will make it.</p>

<p>There remain twenty-one texts which
do speak of the confession of our sins&mdash;very
moving ones indeed&mdash;and Heaven
grant that some day the British public
may be moved by them.</p>

<p>1. The first is Lev. v. 5, "He shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
confess that he hath sinned <i>in that
thing</i>." And if you can get any soul
of your congregation to say he has
sinned in <i>any</i>thing, he may do it in two
words for one if he likes, and it will
yet be good liturgy.</p>

<p>2. The second is indeed general&mdash;Lev.
xvi. 21: the command that the whole
nation should afflict its soul on the great
day of atonement once a year. The
Church of England, I believe, enjoins no
such unpleasant ceremony. Her festivals
are passed by her people often indeed
in the extinction of their souls, but by
no means in their intentional affliction.</p>

<p>3. The third, fourth, and fifth (Lev.
xxvi. 40, Numb. v. 7, Nehem. i. 6) refer
all to national humiliation for definite
idolatry, accompanied with an entire
abandonment of that idolatry, and of
idolatrous persons.  How soon <i>that</i>
form of confession is likely to find a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
place in the English congregations the
defences of their main idol, mammon,
in the vilest and cruellest shape of it&mdash;usury&mdash;with
which this book has
been defiled, show very sufficiently.</p>

<p>6. The sixth is Psalm xxxii. 5&mdash;virtually
the whole of that psalm, which
does, indeed, entirely refer to the
greater confession, once for all opening
the heart to God, which can be by no
means done fifty-two times a year, and
which, once done, puts men into a state
in which they will never again say there
is no health in them; nor that their
hearts are desperately wicked; but will
obey for ever the instantly following
order, "Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous,
and shout for joy, all ye that are
true of heart."</p>

<p>7. The seventh is the one confession
in which I can myself share:&mdash;"After
the way which they call heresy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
so worship I the Lord God of my
fathers."</p>

<p>8. The eighth, James v. 16, tells us to
confess our faults&mdash;not to God, but "one
to another"&mdash;a practice not favoured
by English catechumens&mdash;(by the way,
what <i>do</i> you all mean by "auricular"
confession&mdash;confession that can be
heard? and is the Protestant pleasanter
form one that can't be?)</p>

<p>9. The ninth is that passage of St.
John (i. 9), the favourite evangelical
text, which is read and preached by
thousands of false preachers every day,
without once going on to read its great
companion, "Beloved, if our heart
condemn us, God is greater than our
heart, and knoweth all things; but if
our heart condemn us <i>not</i>, then have
we confidence toward God."  Make
your people understand the second text,
and they will understand the first. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
present you leave them understanding
neither.</p>

<p>And the entire body of the remaining
texts is summed in Joshua vii. 19 and
Ezra x. 11, in which, whether it be
Achan, with his Babylonish garment,
or the people of Israel, with their Babylonish
lusts, the meaning of confession
is simply what it is to every brave boy,
girl, man, and woman, who knows the
meaning of the word "honour" before
God or man&mdash;namely, to say what they
have done wrong, and to take the punishment
of it (not to get it blanched over by
any means), and to do it no more&mdash;which
is so far from being a tone of mind
generally enforced either by the English,
or any other extant Liturgy, that,
though all my maids are exceedingly
pious, and insist on the privilege of
going to church as a quite inviolable
one, I think it a scarcely to be hoped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
for crown and consummation of virtue
in them that they should tell me when
they have broken a plate; and I should
expect to be met only with looks of
indignation and astonishment if I ventured
to ask one of them how she had
spent her Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>"Without courage," said Sir Walter
Scott, "there is no truth; and without
truth there is no virtue." The sentence
would have been itself more true if
Sir Walter had written "candour" for
"truth," for it is possible to be true
in insolence, or true in cruelty. But
in looking back from the ridges of the
Hill Difficulty in my own past life, and
in all the vision that has been given
me of the wanderings in the ways of
others&mdash;this, of all principles, has become
to me surest&mdash;that the first virtue
to be required of man is frankness of
heart and lip: and I believe that every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
youth of sense and honour, putting
himself to faithful question, would feel
that he had the devil for confessor, if
he had not his father or his friend.</p>

<p>That a clergyman should ever be so
truly the friend of his parishioners as
to deserve their confidence from childhood
upwards, may be flouted as a sentimental
ideal; but he is assuredly only
their enemy in showing his Lutheran
detestation of the sale of indulgences by
broadcasting these gratis from his pulpit.</p>

<p>The inconvenience and unpleasantness
of a catechism concerning itself
with the personal practice as well as
the general theory of duty, are indeed
perfectly conceivable by me; yet I am
not convinced that such manner of catechism
would therefore be less medicinal;
and during the past ten years it
has often been matter of amazed
thought with me, while our President<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
at Corpus read prayers to the chapel
benches, what might by this time have
been the effect on the learning as well
as the creed of the University, if, forty
years ago, our stern old Dean Gaisford,
of the House of Christ, instead of sending
us to chapel as to the house of
correction, when we missed a lecture,
had inquired, before he allowed us to
come to chapel at all, whether we were
gamblers, harlot-mongers, or in concealed
and selfish debt.</p>

<p>I observe with extreme surprise in
the preceding letters the unconsciousness
of some of your correspondents,
that there ever was such a thing as
discipline in the Christian Church.
Indeed, the last wholesome instance
of it I can remember was when my
own great-great uncle Maitland lifted
Lady &mdash;&mdash; from his altar rails, and
led her back to her seat before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
congregation, when she offered to take
the Sacrament, being at enmity with
her son.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> But I believe a few hours
honestly spent by any clergyman on
his Church history would show him
that the Church's confidence in her
prayer has been always exactly proportionate
to the strictness of her discipline;
that her present fright at being
caught praying by a chemist or an
electrician, results mainly from her
having allowed her twos and threes
gathered in the name of Christ to become
sixes and sevens gathered in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
name of Belial; and that therefore her
now needfullest duty is to explain to
her stammering votaries, extremely
doubtful as they are of the effect of
their supplications either on politics or
the weather, that although Elijah was
a man subject to like passions as we
are, he had them better under command;
and that while the effectual
fervent prayer of a righteous man
availeth much, the formal and lukewarm
one of an iniquitous man availeth&mdash;much
the other way.</p>



<p>Such an instruction, coupled with due
explanation of the nature of righteousness
and iniquity, directed mainly to
those who have the power of both in
their own hands, being makers of law,
and holders of property, would, without
any further debate, bring about a very
singular change in the position and
respectability of English clergymen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span></p>

<p>How far they may at present be considered
as merely the Squire's left hand,
bound to know nothing of what he is
doing with his right, it is for their own
consciences to determine.</p>

<p>For instance, a friend wrote to me
the other day, "Will you not come
here? You will see a noble duke destroying
a village as old as the Conquest,
and driving out dozens of families whose
names are in Domesday Book, because,
owing to the neglect of his ancestors
and rackrenting for a hundred years,
the place has fallen out of repair, and
the people are poor, and may become
paupers. A local paper ventured to tell
the truth. The duke's agent called
on the editor, and threatened him with
destruction if he did not hold his
tongue." The noble duke, doubtless,
has proper Protestant horror of auricular
confession.  But suppose, instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
the local editor, the local parson had
ventured to tell the truth from his
pulpit, and even to intimate to his
Grace that he might no longer receive
the Body and Blood of the Lord at the
altar of that parish. The parson would
scarcely&mdash;in these days&mdash;have been
therefore made bonfire of, and had a
pretty martyr's memorial by Mr. Scott's
pupils; but he would have lighted a
goodly light, nevertheless, in this England
of ours, whose pettifogging piety
has now neither the courage to deny
a duke's grace in its church, nor to
declare Christ's in its Parliament.</p>

<p>Lastly. Several of your contributors,
I observe, have rashly dipped their feet
in the brim of the water of that raging
question of Usury; and I cannot but
express my extreme regret that you
should yourself have yielded to the
temptation of expressing opinions which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
you have had no leisure either to
found or to test. My assertion, however,
that the rich lived mainly by
robbing the poor, referred not to Usury,
but to Rent; and the facts respecting
both these methods of extortion are
perfectly and indubitably ascertainable
by any person who himself wishes to
ascertain them, and is able to take the
necessary time and pains. I see no
sign, throughout the whole of these
letters, of any wish whatever, on the
part of one of their writers, to ascertain
the facts, but only to defend practices
which they hold to be convenient in the
world, and are afraid to blame in their
congregations. Of the presumption
with which several of the writers utter
their notions on the subject, I do not
think it would be right to speak farther,
in an epilogue to which there is no
reply, in the terms which otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
would have been deserved. In their
bearing on other topics, let me earnestly
thank you (so far as my own feelings
may be permitted voice in the matter) for
the attention with which you have examined,
and the courage with which you
have ratified, or at least endured, letters
which could not but bear at first the aspect
of being written in a hostile&mdash;sometimes
even in a mocking spirit. That aspect
is untrue, nor am I answerable for it:
the things of which I had to speak
could not be shortly described but in
terms which might sound satirical; for
all error, if frankly shown, is precisely
most ridiculous when it is most dangerous,
and I have written no word which
is not chosen as the exactest for its
occasion, whether it move sigh or smile.
In my earlier days I wrote much with
the desire to please, and the hope of
influencing the reader.  As I grow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
older and older, I recognize the truth
of the Preacher's saying, "Desire shall
fail, and the mourners go about the
streets;" and I content myself with
saying, to whoso it may concern, that
the thing is verily thus, whether they
will hear or whether they will forbear.
No man more than I has ever loved
the places where God's honour dwells,
or yielded truer allegiance to the teaching
of His evident servants. No man
at this time grieves more for the danger
of the Church which supposes him her
enemy, while she whispers procrastinating
<i>pax vobiscum</i> in answer to the
spurious kiss of those who would fain
toll curfew over the last fires of English
faith, and watch the sparrow find
nest where she may lay her young,
around the altars of the Lord.</p>

rather pride myself upon. One of your correspondents
greatly doubts my having heard five thousand assertors
of evangelical principles (Catholic-absolvent or
Protestant-detergent are virtually the same). I am
now sixty years old, and for forty-five of them was in
church at least once on the Sunday,&mdash;say once a month
also in afternoons,&mdash;and you have above three thousand
church services. When I am abroad I am often
in half-a-dozen churches in the course of a single day,
and never lose a chance of listening to anything that
is going on. Add the conversations pursued, not unearnestly,
with every sort of reverend person I can
get to talk to me&mdash;from the Bishop of Strasburg
(as good a specimen of a town bishop as I have
known), with whom I was studying ecstatic paintings
in the year 1850&mdash;down to the simplest travelling
tinker inclined Gospelwards, whom I perceive to be
sincere, and your correspondent will perceive that my
rapid numerical expression must be far beneath the
truth. He subjoins his more rational doubt of my
acquaintance with many town missionaries; to which
I can only answer, that as I do not live in town, nor
set up for a missionary myself, my spiritual advantages
have certainly not been great in that direction.
I simply assert that of the few I have known,&mdash;beginning
with Mr. Spurgeon, under whom I sat with much
edification for a year or two,&mdash;I have not known any
such teaching as I speak of.

of Latin and the other of Saxon derivation.

<p>Mr. Ruskin having kindly entrusted me with
his valuable English thirteenth century MS.
service book, referred to p. 295, I have thought
it would be interesting to the readers of this
volume to see a little more in detail some of
the origins of our Litany and Collects. I
think it will be owned that our Reformers
failed to mend some of them in the translation.
I am quite unversed in the reading of ancient
MSS., but I hope the following, with the
translation, will not be found incorrect. I
have preserved neither the contractions nor
the responses repeated after each petition, and
have changed the mediæval "e" into "æ,"
as "terre" into "terræ."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor.</span></p>

<p>O God, whose property it is always to pity and

chain of their sins keeps bound, through Jesus
Christ our Lord.</p>

<p>O Lord, receive with indulgence the prayers of
Thy Church, that all adversities being overcome,
it may serve Thee in freedom without fear.</p>

<p>Almighty, Eternal God, who alone doest great
wonders, grant to Thy servant our bishop, and
to all the congregations committed to him, the
healthful spirit of Thy grace; and that they may
please Thee in truth, pour out upon them the
perpetual dew of Thy blessing.</p>

who art the consoler of the meek and the strength
of the faithful, and the protector of all that trust
in Thee, give to our king and queen and to the
Christian people wisely to manifest the glory of
Thy power, that by Thee they may ever be restored
to forgiveness.</p>

<p>Extend, O Lord, over Thy servants and handmaidens,
the right hand of Thy heavenly aid, that
they may draw near unto Thee with all their heart,
and worthily obtain their petitions.</p>

<p>Kindle with the fire of Thy Holy Spirit our
reins and our hearts, O Lord, that we may serve
Thee with a clean heart, and please Thee with a
pure body.</p>

<p>O God, from whom are all holy desires, right
counsels, and just works, give unto Thy servants
that peace which the world cannot give, that both
our hearts (may obey) Thy commands, and the
fear of the enemy being taken away, we may have
quiet times by Thy protection.</p>

<p>Upon one of the blank leaves of this MS.
are some interesting remarks upon its probable
date, furnished by Mr. Ruskin himself.
"The style, and pieces of inner evidence in
all this book speak it clearly of the first half of
the thirteenth century. The architecture is all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
round arched&mdash;the roofs of Norman simplicity&mdash;unpinnacled&mdash;the
severe and simple forms
of letter are essentially Norman, and the leaf
and ball terminations of the spiral of the extremities,
exactly intermediate between the
Norman and Gothic types. The ivy and geranium
leaves begin to show themselves long
before the end of the thirteenth century, and
there is not a trace of them in this book."
This evidence of early date, however, is qualified
by the further statement, "old styles
sometimes hold on long in provincial MSS."</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
